On this page, you will find simplified deployment instructions and Helm values to get you started with the latest release of Pachyderm on the Kubernetes Engine of your choice (AWS (EKS), Google (GKS), and Azure (AKS)).


For each cloud provider, we will give you the option to "quick deploy" Pachyderm with or without Console (Pachyderm UI available with Enterprise).

{{% notice info %}}
The deployment steps highlighted in this document are **not intended for production**. For production settings, please read our [infrastructure recommendations](../ingress/). In particular, we recommend:

  - the use of a **managed PostgreSQL server** (RDS, CloudSQL, or PostgreSQL Server) rather than Pachyderm's default bundled PostgreSQL.
  - the setup of a **TCP Load Balancer** in front of your pachd service.
  - the setup of an **Ingress Controller** in front of Console. 

Then find your targeted Cloud provider in the [Deploy and Manage](../) ection of this documentation.

## 1. Prerequisites

Pachyderm is deployed on a Kubernetes Cluster.

Install the following clients on your machine before you start creating your cluster. 
Use the latest available version of the components listed below.

* [kubectl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az_aks_install_cli): the cli to interact with your cluster.
* [pachctl](../../../getting-started/local-installation#install-pachctl): the cli to interact with Pachyderm.
* Install [`Helm`](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for your deployment. 


{{% notice warning %}} 
Optional - Quick deployment of Pachyderm Enterprise (with Console)

- The deployment of Console (Pachyderm UI) **requires a valid enterprise token**. To get your free-trial token, fill in [this form](https://www.pachyderm.com/trial/), get in touch with us at [sales@pachyderm.io](mailto:sales@pachyderm.io), or on our [Slack](https://www.pachyderm.com/slack/). 
- When deploying with Console, we create a default mock user (username:`admin`, password: `password`) to authenticate yourself to Console so you don't have to connect an Identity Provider to make things work. The mock user is a [Cluster Admin]().

For a better understanding of the additional steps and helm values needed when deploying with Console in a production environment, read about the [deployment of Pachyderm with Console](../console/#deploy-in-the-cloud) page.

 deployTarget: "MICROSOFT"
 pachd:
   storage:
     microsoft:
       # storage container name
       container: "blah"

   # pachyderm enterprise key
   enterpriseLicenseKey: "YOUR_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN"
 console:
   enabled: true
```



Jump to [Helm install](#3-helm-install)

## 3. [Helm Install](../helm-install/#install-pachyderms-helm-chart)
- You will be deploying the [latest GA release](../../../reference/supported-releases/#generally-available-ga) of Pachyderm:

  ```s
  helm repo add pach https://helm.pachyderm.com
  helm repo update
  helm install pachyderm -f my_pachyderm_values.yaml pach/pachyderm 
  ```

- Check your deployment:

  ```s
  kubectl get pods
  ```

  Once the pods are up, you should see a pod for `pachd` running 
  (alongside etcd, pg-bouncer or postgres, console, depending on your installation). 
  If you are curious about the architecture of Pachyderm, take a look at our [high-level architecture diagram](../../).
  
  **System Response:**

  ```s
  NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  etcd-0                         1/1     Running   0          18h
  pachd-5db79fb9dd-b2gdq         1/1     Running   2          18h
  postgres-0                     1/1     Running   0          18h
  ```

## 4. Have 'pachctl' And Your Cluster Communicate

### You have deployed Pachyderm without Console

- Retrieve the external IP address of pachd service:
  ```s
  kubectl get services | grep pachd-lb | awk '{print $4}'
  ```
- Then **update your context for pachctl to point at your cluster**:

  ```s
  echo '{"pachd_address": "grpc://<external-IP-address>:30650"}' | pachctl config set context "<choose-a-cluster-context-name>" --overwrite
  ```

  ```s
  pachctl config set active-context "<your-cluster-context-name>"
  ```

#### You have deployed Pachyderm with Console
- To connect to your new Pachyderm instance, run:

  ```s
  pachctl config import-kube local --overwrite
  ```
  ```s
  pachctl config set active-context local
  ```

- Then run `pachctl port-forward` (Background this process in a new tab of your terminal).

- Note that you will need to run `pachctl auth login` then authenticate to Pachyderm with the mock User (username:`admin`, password: `password`) to use `pachctl`

- Finally, check that your cluster is up and running

  ```s
  pachctl version
  ```

  **System Response:**

  ```s
  COMPONENT           VERSION
  pachctl             {{% latestPatchNumber %}}
  pachd               {{% latestPatchNumber %}}
  ```

## 5. Connect to Console
To connect to your Console (Pachyderm UI):

- Point your browser to `http://localhost:4000` 
- Authenticate as the mock User using `admin` & `password` 

You are all set!
