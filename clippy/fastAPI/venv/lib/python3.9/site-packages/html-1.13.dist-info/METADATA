Simple, elegant HTML generation.

Constructing your HTML
----------------------

To construct HTML start with an instance of ``html.HTML()``. Add
tags by accessing the tag's attribute on that object. For example:

>>> from html import HTML
>>> h = HTML()
>>> h.br
>>> print h                          # or print(h) in python 3+
<br>

If the tag should have text content you may pass it at tag creation time or
later using the tag's ``.text()`` method (note it is assumed that a fresh
``HTML`` instance is created for each of the following examples):

>>> p = h.p('hello world!\n')
>>> p.text('more &rarr; text', escape=False)
>>> h.p
>>> print h
<p>hello, world!
more &rarr; text</p>
<p>

Any HTML-specific characters (``<>&"``) in the text will be escaped for HTML
safety as appropriate unless ``escape=False`` is passed. Note also that the
top-level ``HTML`` object adds newlines between tags by default. Finally in
the above you'll see an empty paragraph tag - tags with no contents get no
closing tag.

If the tag should have sub-tags you have two options. You may either add
the sub-tags directly on the tag:

>>> l = h.ol
>>> l.li('item 1')
>>> l.li.b('item 2 > 1')
>>> print h
<ol>
<li>item 1</li>
<li><b>item 2 &gt; 1</b></li>
</ol>

Note that the default behavior with lists (and tables) is to add newlines
between sub-tags to generate a nicer output. You can also see in that
example the chaining of tags in ``l.li.b``. If you wished you could add
attributes to those chained tags, eg: ``l.li(id="special").b``.

The alternative to the above method is to use the containter tag as a
context for adding the sub-tags. The top-level ``HTML`` object keeps track
of which tag is the current context:

>>> with h.table(border='1'):
...   for i in range(2):
...     with h.tr:
...       h.td('column 1')
...       h.td('column 2')
...  print h
<table border="1">
<tr><td>column 1</td><td>column 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>column 1</td><td>column 2</td></tr>
</table>

Note the addition of an attribute to the ``<table>`` tag.

A variation on the above is to explicitly reference the context variable,
but then there's really no benefit to using a ``with`` statement. The
following is functionally identical to the first list construction:

>>> with h.ol as l:
...   l.li('item 1')
...   l.li.b('item 2 > 1')

You may turn off/on adding newlines by passing ``newlines=False`` or
``True`` to the tag (or ``HTML`` instance) at creation time:

>>> l = h.ol(newlines=False)
>>> l.li('item 1')
>>> l.li('item 2')
>>> print h
<ol><li>item 1</li><li>item 2</li></ol>

That control is also available as the ``newlines`` attribute on the
``HTML`` or tag instance if you need to alter it after instantiation.

Since we can't use ``class`` as a keyword, the library recognises ``klass``
as a substitute:

>>> print h.p(content, klass="styled")
<p class="styled">content</p>


Unicode
-------

``HTML`` will work with either regular strings **or** unicode strings, but
not **both at the same time**.

Obtain the final unicode string by calling ``unicode()`` on the ``HTML``
instance:

>>> h = HTML()
>>> h.p(u'Some Euro: €1.14')
>>> unicode(h)
u'<p>Some Euro: €1.14</p>'

If (under Python 2.x) you add non-unicode strings or attempt to get the
resultant HTML source through any means other than ``unicode()`` then you
will most likely get one of the following errors raised:

UnicodeDecodeError
   Probably means you've added non-unicode strings to your HTML.
UnicodeEncodeError
   Probably means you're trying to get the resultant HTML using ``print``
   or ``str()`` (or ``%s``).


How generation works
--------------------

The HTML document is generated when the ``HTML`` instance is "stringified".
This could be done either by invoking ``str()`` on it, or just printing it.
It may also be returned directly as the "iterable content" from a WSGI app
function.

You may also render any tag or sub-tag at any time by stringifying it.

Tags with no contents (either text or sub-tags) will have no closing tag.
There is no "special list" of tags that must always have closing tags, so
if you need to force a closing tag you'll need to provide some content,
even if it's just a single space character.

Rendering doesn't affect the HTML document's state, so you can add to or
otherwise manipulate the HTML after you've stringified it.


Creating XHTML
--------------

To construct XHTML start with an instance of ``html.XHTML()`` and use it
as you would an ``HTML`` instance. Empty elements will now be rendered
with the appropriate XHTML minimized tag syntax. For example:

>>> from html import XHTML
>>> h = XHTML()
>>> h.p
>>> h.br
>>> print h
<p></p>
<br />
