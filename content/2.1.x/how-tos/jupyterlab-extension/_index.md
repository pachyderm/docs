![Mount extension in action](../images/mount-extension.gif)

 We implemented a [JupyterLab extension](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-pachyderm/) that selectively **maps the contents of data repositories right into your Jupyter environment**. Any named branch in a repo can be “mounted” into your file system via the Jupyter environment, making it feel like the data in Pachyderm is on your computer. 

 For Data Scientists whose data are stored in Pachyderm, the extension provides a seamless way to:

- Connect your Notebook to a Pachyderm cluster.
- Browse, explore, analyze data stored in Pachyderm directly from your Notebook.
- Run and test out your pipeline code before creating a Docker image. The extension provides a quick and reliable data **development environment** that can be shared.

TL;DR - Quick Start
We will provide two sets of instructions, depending on whether you know the cluster address (`pachd_address`)

- **You know the `pachd_address` of your cluster**:

  - Run:
  ```s
  docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -e GRANT_SUDO=yes --user root --device /dev/fuse --privileged --entrypoint /opt/conda/bin/jupyter pachyderm/notebooks-user:{{% extensionJupyterLab %}}  lab --allow-root
  ```
  - Access your JupyterLab session through a local browser (check the link in the stdout).
  - Then [connect your JupyterLab to your Pachyderm cluster](#connect-the-extension-to-your-pachyderm-cluster). 
  You are ready to start experimenting.


- **You do not know the `pachd_address` of your cluster**:

  - Install `pachctl` (Pachyderm command line tool) on your machine (see [`pachctl` installation instructions](../../getting-started/local-installation/#install-pachctl) ).
  - Then, [connect that CLI to your cluster](../../getting-started/local-installation/#connect-pachctl-to-your-cluster).
  - And run:
  ```s
  docker run -it -v ~/.pachyderm/config.json:/home/jovyan/.pachyderm/config.json -p 8888:8888 -e GRANT_SUDO=yes --user root --device /dev/fuse --privileged --entrypoint /opt/conda/bin/jupyter pachyderm/notebooks-user:{{% extensionJupyterLab %}} lab --allow-root
  ```
  - Access your JupyterLab session through a local browser (check the link in the stdout).
  You are all logged in. Start experimenting.

Note that we are assuming that you **already have a Pachyderm cluster running** to connect your JupyterLab instance. Find Pachyderm installation instructions in the [Deploy/Manage](../../deploy-manage/deploy) section of our documentation.
## Using The Extension

{{% notice warning %}} 
Troubleshooting - When in doubt, restart your mount server

JupyterLab Mount Extension is an [experimental feature](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/reference/supported-releases/#experimental). Many issues can be resolved by restarting the mount server, should you find yourself in an odd situation. To kill/restart your server, run the following command from the terminal window in jupyterlab:
```s
pkill -f "pachctl mount-server" 
```
The server will restart by itself.

### Connect The Extension To Your Pachyderm Cluster

To connect the extension to your Pachyderm cluster, fill in the full `pachd_address` (i.e., Pachyderm cluster address) in the login form accessible by clicking on the mount extension icon in the far left tab bar. It should look like "grpc://`<external-IP-address-or-domain-name>`:`<port-number>`".

If you are experimenting with data living in different Pachyderm clusters, you can change the connection string and direct your notebooks to another cluster.

You might be prompted to authenticate in a separate tab of your browser if Authentication has been turned on on the cluster you are exploring data from.

### Mount / Unmount A Branch

After connecting to your cluster via the login interface, you are presented with a list of the repos in your cluster. **Any named branch in a repo can be “mounted” into your file system** by clicking the mount button next to the repo. 

The extension connects to your versioned data stored in Pachyderm and simulates a mounted drive on your file system at `/pfs`, similar to how a pipeline would see data when running a job. Files are lazily loaded, meaning they are only downloaded locally when you access them. This saves you time by only **loading the data as you access it**.

To make interacting with the mounted data easier, the extension also provides you with a file browser to the `/pfs` location. This lets you explore, search and open the data you have mounted in the same way you would the files on your computer. 

You should see the repositories ready to be mounted from your Pachyderm instance.

{{% notice info %}} 
- All mounted repositories are **read-only**. 
- Under the hood, the extension requires FUSE. 
- We apply the `/` globbing pattern to all directories/files in mounted repo@branch.

Make sure to check our [data science notebook examples](https://github.com/pachyderm/examples) running on Pachyderm, from a market sentiment NLP implementation using a FinBERT model to pipelines training a regression model on the Boston Housing Dataset. You will also find integration examples with open-source products, such as labeling or model serving applications. 

## Install The Mount Extension

- Run with our [JupyterLab container](#running-the-jupyterlab-container).

{{% notice info %}} 
- Find the latest available version of our Pachyderm Mount Extension in [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-pachyderm/).
- We recommend JupyterLab >= 3.0.

### Pre-built Image vs Make Your Own

Depending on your setup, you might choose to use our pre-built image containing the extension or add the extension to your image.

- Using Pachyderm's pre-built image `pachyderm/notebooks-user:{{% extensionJupyterLab %}}`:

  {{% notice note %}} 

  Find the latest available tag of the image [`pachyderm/notebooks-user` in DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pachyderm/notebooks-user/tags) to get the latest copy of the extension.

  Our image comes with a pre-installed suite of packages, including:

  - The extension `jupyterlab-pachyderm`. 
  - A custom version of our Command-Line Tool `pachctl`. 
  - FUSE 
  - Additionally, it pre-creates the `/pfs` directory files that will be mounted to and grants ownership to the JupyterLab USER.

  The image is based on a GPU-enabled version of [jupyter/base-notebook¶](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-base-notebook).
  {{% /notice %}}

- Add the extension to your existing Jupyterlab Docker image:

  {{% notice note  %}} 
  Replace the following `${PACHCTL_VERSION}` with the version of `pachctl` that matches your cluster's, and update `<version>` with the release number of the extension.
  {{% /notice %}}

  ```s 
  # This runs the following section as root; if adding to an existing Dockerfile, set the user back to whatever you need. 
  USER root

  # This is the directory files will be mounted to, mirroring how pipelines are run. 
  RUN mkdir -p /pfs 

  # If you are not using "jovyan" as your notebook user, replace the user here. 
  RUN chown $NB_USER /pfs

  # Fuse is a requirement for the mount extension 
  RUN apt-get clean && RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install curl fuse 

  # Install Pachctl - Set the version of Pachctl that matches your cluster deployment. 
  RUN curl -f -o pachctl.deb -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v${PACHCTL_VERSION}/pachctl_${PACHCTL_VERSION}_amd64.deb 
  RUN dpkg -i pachctl.deb

  # This sets the user back to the notebook user account (i.e., Jovyan) 
  USER $NB_UID

  # Replace the version here with the version of the extension you would like to install from https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-pachyderm/ 
  RUN pip install jupyterlab-pachyderm==<version> 
  ```

  Then, [build, tag, and push your image](../developer-workflow/working-with-pipelines/#step-2-build-your-docker-image).

### Running the JupyterLab Container

If you are using our pre-built image:

- Run the script below:

  ```s
  docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -e GRANT_SUDO=yes --user root --device /dev/fuse --privileged --entrypoint /opt/conda/bin/jupyter pachyderm/notebooks-user:{{% extensionJupyterLab %}} lab --allow-root 
  ```

- Click on the link provided in the stdout of your terminal to run JupyterLab in a browser.

- Jump to the [`Connect Your JupyterLab Extension To Your Pachyderm Cluster`](#connect-the-extension-to-your-pachyderm-cluster) section.

Replace the image name with your own image otherwise.

M1 users with Docker Desktop < `4.6`

A [documented issue between qemu and Docker Desktop](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/340) prevents you from running our pre-built Mount Extension Image in Docker Desktop.

We recommend to:

- Use [Podman](https://podman.io) (See installation instructions)
  ```s
  brew install podman
  podman machine init --disk-size 50
  podman machine start
  podman machine ssh
  sudo rpm-ostree install qemu-user-static && sudo systemctl reboot THEN
  ```
 then replace the keyword `docker` with `podman` in all the commands above. 
- Or make sure that your qemu version is > `6.2`.
