## What is a Local Installation? 

A local installation means that you will allocate resources from your local machine (e.g., your laptop) to spin up a Kubernetes cluster to run Pachyderm. This installation method is not for a production setup, but is great for personal use, testing, and product exploration.

## Which Guide Should I Use?

Both the Docker Desktop and Minikube installation guides support **MacOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**. If this is your first time using Kubernetes, try [Docker Desktop](./docker) --- if you are experienced with Kubernetes, you can deploy using a variety of solutions not listed here ([KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/), [Rancher Desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/), [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation), etc.).
