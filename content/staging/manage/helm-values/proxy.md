## About

Proxy is a service that handles all Pachyderm traffic (S3, Console, OIDC, Dex, GRPC) on a single port; It's great for exposing directly to the Internet. 

{{% notice warning %}}
Proxy will soon be the mandatory way to interact with Pachyderm, replacing [Ingress](/{{% release %}}/reference/helm-values/ingress). See [Upgrade to Embedded Proxy](/{{% release %}}/deploy-manage/deploy/deploy-w-proxy/) for more details.
