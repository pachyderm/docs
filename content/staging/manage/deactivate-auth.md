When you deactivate authorization, all permissions granted to users on Pachyderm resources are removed. Everyone that can connect to Pachyderm is back to being a clusterAdmin (can access and modify all data in all repos).

## Before You Start 

- You must be logged in as a `clusterAdmin`.

## How to Deactivate Auth 

```s
pachctl auth deactivate
```
