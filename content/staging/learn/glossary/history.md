History in Pachyderm is a record of the changes made to data over time, stored as a series of immutable snapshots ([commits](TBD)) that can be accessed using [ancestry syntax](TBD) and [branch](TBD) pointers. Each commit has a parentage structure, where new commits inherit content from their parents, creating a chain of commits that represents the full history of changes to the data.
