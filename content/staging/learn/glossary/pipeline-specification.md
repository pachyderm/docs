A pipeline specification is a declarative configuration file used to define the behavior of a Pachyderm [pipeline](TBD). It is typically written in YAML or JSON format and contains information about the pipeline's input sources, output destinations, Docker image ([user code](TBD)), command, and other metadata.

In addition to simply transforming your data, you can also achieve more advanced techniques though the pipeline specification, such as:

- [Deferred professing](TBD)
- [Distributed computing](TBD)
