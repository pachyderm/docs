A file is a Unix filesystem object, which is a directory or file, that stores data. Unlike source code version-control systems that are most suitable for storing plain text files, you can store any type of file in Pachyderm, including binary files. 

Often, data scientists operate with comma-separated values (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), images, and other plain text and binary file formats. Pachyderm supports all file sizes and formats and applies storage optimization techniques, such as deduplication, in the background.
