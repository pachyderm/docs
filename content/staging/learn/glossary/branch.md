A Pachyderm branch is a pointer to a [commit](TBD) that moves along with new commits. By default, Pachyderm does not create any branches when you create a repository. Most users create a `master` branch to initiate the first commit.

Branches allow collaboration between teams of data scientists. However, the `master` branch is sufficient for most users.

Each branch stores information about [provenance](TBD), including input and output branches. Pachyderm pipelines trigger a job when changes are detected in the `HEAD` of a branch.

You can create additional branches with `pachctl create branch` and view branches with `pachctl list branch`. Deleting a branch doesn't delete its commits, and all branches require a head commit.

## Example

```s
pachctl list branch images

# BRANCH HEAD
# master c32879ae0e6f4b629a43429b7ec10ccc
```
