{{% notice note %}}
Pachyderm uses the term `commit` at two different levels: a global level and commits on a repository's branch.
{{% /notice %}}

In Pachyderm, commits snapshot and preserve the state of files and directories in a repository at a point in time.
Unlike Git, Pachyderm commits are centralized and transactional. You can create a commit with `pachctl start commit` and save it with `pachctl finish commit`.

All commits have an alphanumeric ID, and you can reference a commit with `<repo>@<commitID>`. Each commit has an origin that indicates why it was produced (USER, AUTO, or ALIAS).

To track provenance, each commit must belong to exactly one [branch](TBD). You can view commit information with `pachctl list commit` and `pachctl inspect commit`.

You can squash or delete commits with `pachctl squash commit` and `pachctl delete commit`.

## Example 

```s
pachctl list commit images@master

# REPO   BRANCH COMMIT                           FINISHED        SIZE       ORIGIN DESCRIPTION
# images master c6d7be4a13614f2baec2cb52d14310d0 33 minutes ago  5.121MiB    USER
# images master 385b70f90c3247e69e4bdadff12e44b2 2 hours ago     2.561MiB    USER
```

{{% notice warning %}}
`start commit` can only be used on input repos without provenance, and all commits must belong to exactly one branch.
