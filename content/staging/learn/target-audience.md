## Target Audience
Pachyderm is designed for data engineers and data scientists who are managing and processing large amounts of data in a scalable and efficient manner. Pachyderm is ideal for organizations working with big data and require robust, version-controlled, reproducible, and distributed data pipelines.

It is particularly useful for large unstructured data processing jobs, such as dataset curation for computer vision, speech recognition, video analytics, NLP, and many others.

## Non-Target Audience
Pachyderm is not intended for users who do not require large-scale data processing and analysis. For instance, data scientists who are just starting with a small project may not need Pachyderm's distributed system. Additionally, users with limited experience with containerization, cloud computing, and distributed systems may find it challenging to use Pachyderm effectively.
