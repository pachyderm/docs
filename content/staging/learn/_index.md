Pachyderm is a data science platform that provides data-driven pipelines with version control and autoscaling. It is container-native, allowing developers to use the languages and libraries that are best suited to their needs, and runs across all major cloud providers and on-premises installations.

The platform is built on Kubernetes and integrates with standard tools for CI/CD, logging, authentication, and data APIs, making it scalable and incredibly flexible. Pachyderm’s data-driven pipelines allow you to automatically trigger data processing based on changes in your data, and the platform’s autoscaling capabilities ensure that resource utilization is optimized, maximizing developer efficiency.
