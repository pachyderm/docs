Enterprise helps you scale and manage Pachyderm data pipelines by removing all [scaling limits](../../reference/scaling-limits/) and providing you with additional features not available in the Community Edition.

## Additional Features

- [**Authentication**](../auth/authentication/idp-dex): Authenticate against your favorite OIDC providers.
- [**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**](../auth/authorization/): Use RBAC on pachyderm resources (clusters, projects, repos), silo data, and prevent unintended changes on production pipelines.
- [**Enterprise Server**](../auth/enterprise-server/setup/): Simplify licensing and Identity Provider management by using one Enterprise server to register many Pachyderm clusters.
- Additionally, you have access to a pachctl command that [pauses (`pachctl enterprise pause`) and unpauses (`pachctl enterprise unpause`) your cluster](../../deploy-manage/manage/backup-restore) for a backup and restore.
