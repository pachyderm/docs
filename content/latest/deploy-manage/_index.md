We are now shipping Pachyderm with an **embedded proxy** 
allowing your cluster to expose one single port externally. This deployment setup is optional.

If you choose to deploy Pachyderm with a Proxy, check out our new recommended architecture and [deployment instructions](../deploy-manage/deploy/deploy-w-proxy/).
