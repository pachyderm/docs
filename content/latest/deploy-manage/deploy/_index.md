Pachyderm runs on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/),
is backed by an object store of your choice, and comes with a bundled version of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (metadata storage) by default. 

We recommended disabling the bundled PostgreSQL and using a **managed database instance** (such as RDS, CloudSQL, or PostgreSQL Server) for production environments.
