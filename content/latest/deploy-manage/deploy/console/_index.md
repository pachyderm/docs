Pachyderm **Console is a complete web UI for visualizing running pipelines and exploring your data**. By clicking on individual pipeline segments, users can check their jobs' status, visualize their commits' content, access logs, and much more! It is a valuable companion when troubleshooting pipelines.

## Enterprise Edition
Pachyderm Community Edition comes with Console per default. Upon upgrading to Pachyderm Enterprise, you will be able to:

- Benefit from our Authentication/Authorization features and control which users, groups, or roles have access to specific Pachyderm resources.
- Lift all [CE scaling limits](../../../reference/scaling-limits/).

## Console States 
Before diving into Console installation steps, please look at Console's various states, from the Community Edition to Enterprise. It should give you a mental model of the various paths to upgrade your Community Edition and what happens when your Enterprise token expires.
