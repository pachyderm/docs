## Spec

```s

"s3_out": bool,

```

## Behavior 

`s3_out` allows your pipeline code to write results out to an S3 gateway
endpoint instead of the typical `pfs/out` directory. When this parameter
is set to `true`, Pachyderm includes a sidecar S3 gateway instance
container in the same pod as the pipeline container. The address of the
output repository will be `s3://<output_repo>`. 

If you want to expose an input repository through an S3 gateway, see
`input.pfs.s3` in [PFS Input](#pfs-input). 

## When to Use 

You should use the s3 Out attribute when you'd like to access and store the results of your Pachyderm transformations externally.
