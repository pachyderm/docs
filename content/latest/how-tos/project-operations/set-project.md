## Before You Start 

- Pachyderm ships with an initial project named `default` that is automatically set to your active context.

## How to Set a Project to Your Current Context

{{<stack type="wizard">}}
{{% wizardRow id="Tool"%}}
{{% wizardButton option="Pachctl CLI" state="active" %}}
{{% wizardButton option="Console" %}}
{{% /wizardRow %}}

{{% wizardResults  %}}

{{% wizardResult val1="tool/pachctl-cli"%}}

In order to begin working on a project other than the `default` project, you must assign it to a pachCTL context. This enables you to safely add or update resources such as pipelines and repos without affecting other projects.


```s
pachctl config update context --project foo
```

You can check the details of your active context using the following commands:

 ```s
 pachctl config get active-context # returns contextName
 pachctl config get context <contextName>

# {
#   "source": "IMPORTED",
#   "cluster_name": "docker-desktop",
#   "auth_info": "docker-desktop",
#   "cluster_deployment_id": "dev",
#   "project": "foo"
# }
```

{{% /wizardResult %}}

{{% wizardResult val1="tool/console"%}}

1. Open the Console UI.
2. Navigate to the top-level Projects view. 
3. Scroll to a project you wish to work on.
4. Select **View Project**. 

You can now work within the project from Console.
