Use the [JupyterLab extension](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-pachyderm/) to:

- Connect your Notebook to a Pachyderm cluster
- Browse, explore, and analyze data stored in Pachyderm directly from your Notebook
- Run and test out your pipeline code before creating a Docker image

## Install the Extension 

There are two main ways to install the Jupyter Lab extension:

- ⭐ [Via Docker](./docker-install): Fastest implementation!
- 🧪 [Locally](./local-install): Great for development and testing

## Examples 

Make sure to check our [data science notebook examples](https://github.com/pachyderm/examples) running on Pachyderm, from a market sentiment NLP implementation using a FinBERT model to pipelines training a regression model on the Boston Housing Dataset. You will also find integration examples with open-source products, such as labeling or model serving applications.
