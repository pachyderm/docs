Use the [JupyterLab extension](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-pachyderm/) to:

- Connect your Notebook to a Pachyderm cluster
- Browse, explore, and analyze data stored in Pachyderm directly from your Notebook
- Run and test out your pipeline code before creating a Docker image

## Examples 

Make sure to check our [data science notebook examples](https://github.com/pachyderm/examples) running on Pachyderm, from a market sentiment NLP implementation using a FinBERT model to pipelines training a regression model on the Boston Housing Dataset. You will also find integration examples with open-source products, such as labeling or model serving applications.
