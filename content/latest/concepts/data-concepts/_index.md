Pachyderm data concepts describe **version-control primitives** that you interact with when you use Pachyderm.

These ideas are conceptually similar to the Git version-control system with a few notable exceptions. Because Pachyderm deals not only with plain text but also with binary files and
large datasets, it does not process the data in the same way as Git. When you use Git, you store a copy of the repository on your local machine. You work with that copy, apply your changes, and then send the changes to the upstream master copy of the repository where it gets merged.

Pachyderm version control works slightly differently. In Pachyderm, only a centralized repository exists and you do not store any local copies of that repository. Therefore, the merge, in the traditional Git meaning, does not occur.

Instead, your data can be continuously updated in the master branch of your repo, while you can experiment with specific data commits in a separate branch or branches. Because of this behavior, you cannot run into a merge conflict with Pachyderm.
