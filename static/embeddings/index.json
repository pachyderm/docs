		"body": " Pachyderm File System # The Pachyderm File System (PFS) is the backbone of the Pachyderm data platform, providing a secure, scalable, and efficient way to store and manage large amounts of data. It is a version-controlled data management system that enables users to store any type of data in any format and scale, from a single file to a directory of files. The PFS is built on top of Postgres and S3, ensuring that your data is secure, consistent, and easily accessible. With PFS, users can version their data and work collaboratively with their teams, using branches and commits to manage and track changes over time.\nRepositories (Repo) # Pachyderm repositories are version controlled, meaning that they keep track of changes to the data stored within them. Each repository can contain any type of data, including individual files or directories of files, and can handle data of any scale.\nLearn more about Repositories\nBranches # Branches in Pachyderm are similar to branches in Git. They are pointers to commits that move along a growing chain of commits. This allows you to work with different versions of your data within the same repository.\nLearn more about Branches\nCommits # A commit in Pachyderm is created automatically whenever data is added to or deleted from a repository. Each commit preserves the state of all files in the repository at the time of the commit, similar to a snapshot. Each commit is uniquely identifiable by a UUID and is immutable, meaning that the source data can never change.\nLearn more about Commits\nPachyderm Pipeline System # The Pachyderm Pipeline System (PPS) is a core component of the Pachyderm platform, designed to run robust data pipelines in a scalable and reproducible manner. With PPS, you can define, execute, and monitor complex data transformations using code that is run in Docker containers. The output of each pipeline is version-controlled in a Pachyderm data repository, providing a complete, auditable history of all processing steps. In this way, PPS provides a flexible, data-driven solution for managing your data processing needs, while keeping data and processing results secure, reproducible, and scalable.\nLearn more about the PPS\nPipelines # Pachyderm pipelines are used to transform data from Pachyderm repositories. The output data is versioned in a Pachyderm data repository, and the code for the transformation is run in Docker containers. Pipelines are triggered by new commits to a branch, making them data-driven.\nLearn more about Pipelines\nJobs # A job in Pachyderm is the execution of a pipeline with a new commit. The data is distributed and parallelized computation is performed across a cluster. Each job is uniquely identified, making it possible to reproduce the results of a specific job.\nLearn more about Jobs\nDatum # A datum in Pachyderm is a unit of computation for a job. It is used to distribute the processing workloads and to define how data can be split for parallel processing.\nLearn more about Datums\n",

		"body": " Introduction to Data Versioning # On this page we want to give a brief overview of how to use and interact with versioned data inside Pachyderm. Collectively, this is often referred to as the Pachyderm File System (PFS).\nRepositories # Data versioning in Pachyderm starts with creating a data repository. Pachyderm data repos are similar to Git repositories in that they provide a place to track changes made to a set of files.\nUsing the Pachyderm CLI (pachctl) we would create a repository called data with the create repo command.\npachctl create repo data Once a repo is created, data can be added, deleted, or updated to a branch and all changes are versioned with commits.\nCommits # In Pachyderm, commits are made to branches of a repo. For example, in the following session if we add a file to our data repository, that file will be captured in a commit.\n$ pachctl put file data@master -f my_file.bin $ pachctl list commit images@master REPO BRANCH COMMIT FINISHED SIZE ORIGIN data master 6806cce 4 seconds ago 57.27KiB USER $ pachctl list file data@master NAME TYPE SIZE /my_file.bin file 57.27KiB If we then delete that file, it is removed from the active state of the branch, but the commit still exists.\n$ pachctl delete file data@master:/my_file.bin $ pachctl list commit data@master REPO BRANCH COMMIT FINISHED SIZE ORIGIN data master ff1867a 3 seconds ago 0B USER data master 6806cce 20 seconds ago 57.27KiB USER $ pachctl list file data@master NAME TYPE SIZE Then if we add the file back, we\u0026rsquo;ll see a third commit.\n$ pachctl create file data@master:/my_file.bin $ pachctl list commit data@master REPO BRANCH COMMIT FINISHED SIZE ORIGIN data master 0ec029b 20 seconds ago 57.27KiB USER data master ff1867a 3 seconds ago 0B USER data master 6806cce 20 seconds ago 57.27KiB USER $ pachctl list file data@master NAME TYPE SIZE /my_file.bin file 57.27KiB Visualizing the commit history for the master branch looks like the following.\n%%{init: { \u0026#39;logLevel\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gitGraph\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;showBranches\u0026#39;: true, \u0026#39;showCommitLabel\u0026#39;:true,\u0026#39;mainBranchName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;data\u0026#39;}} }%% gitGraph commit id:\u0026#34;6806cce\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;ff1867a\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;0ec029b\u0026#34; tag: \u0026#34;master\u0026#34; Branches are a critical for tracking commits.

Navigating these commits is an important aspect of working with PFS, and allows you to easily manage the history and evolution of your data.\nOne useful feature for navigating commits in PFS is the ability to refer to a previous commit using ancestry syntax. This syntax allows you to specify a commit relative to the current one, making it easy to compare and manipulate different versions of your data.\nThis makes it simple to switch between different versions of your data, and to perform operations like diffing, branching, and merging.\n%%{init: { \u0026#39;logLevel\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gitGraph\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;showBranches\u0026#39;: true, \u0026#39;showCommitLabel\u0026#39;:true,\u0026#39;mainBranchName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;data@master^\u0026#39;}} }%% gitGraph commit id:\u0026#34;6806cce\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;ff1867a\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;0ec029b\u0026#34; type:HIGHLIGHT commit id:\u0026#34;b69b3e3\u0026#34; tag: \u0026#34;HEAD\u0026#34; To refer to the commit 2 before the HEAD:\n%%{init: { \u0026#39;logLevel\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gitGraph\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;showBranches\u0026#39;: true, \u0026#39;showCommitLabel\u0026#39;:true,\u0026#39;mainBranchName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;data@master^^\u0026#39;}} }%% gitGraph commit id:\u0026#34;6806cce\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;ff1867a\u0026#34; type:HIGHLIGHT commit id:\u0026#34;0ec029b\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;b69b3e3\u0026#34; tag: \u0026#34;HEAD\u0026#34; Similarly, we can abbreviate this with the following syntax:\n%%{init: { \u0026#39;logLevel\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gitGraph\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;showBranches\u0026#39;: true, \u0026#39;showCommitLabel\u0026#39;:true,\u0026#39;mainBranchName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;data@master^2\u0026#39;}} }%% gitGraph commit id:\u0026#34;6806cce\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;ff1867a\u0026#34; type:HIGHLIGHT commit id:\u0026#34;0ec029b\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;b69b3e3\u0026#34; tag: \u0026#34;HEAD\u0026#34; We can reference the commits in numerical order using .n, where n is the commit number.\n%%{init: { \u0026#39;logLevel\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gitGraph\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;showBranches\u0026#39;: true, \u0026#39;showCommitLabel\u0026#39;:true,\u0026#39;mainBranchName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;data@master.1\u0026#39;}} }%% gitGraph commit id:\u0026#34;6806cce\u0026#34; type:HIGHLIGHT commit id:\u0026#34;ff1867a\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;0ec029b\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;b69b3e3\u0026#34; tag: \u0026#34;HEAD\u0026#34; %%{init: { \u0026#39;logLevel\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gitGraph\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;showBranches\u0026#39;: true, \u0026#39;showCommitLabel\u0026#39;:true,\u0026#39;mainBranchName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;data@master.-1\u0026#39;}} }%% gitGraph commit id:\u0026#34;6806cce\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;ff1867a\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;0ec029b\u0026#34; type:HIGHLIGHT commit id:\u0026#34;b69b3e3\u0026#34; tag: \u0026#34;HEAD\u0026#34; Branches # In Pachyderm, branches are used to track changes in a repository. You can think of a branch as a tag on a specific commit. Branches are associated with a particular commit and are updated as new commits are made (moving the HEAD of that branch to its most recent commit). This also means that at any time, you can change the commit that a branch is associated with, affecting branch history.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of a repo with three branches, each with its own history of commits:\n%%{init: { \u0026#39;logLevel\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gitGraph\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;showBranches\u0026#39;: true, \u0026#39;showCommitLabel\u0026#39;:true,\u0026#39;mainBranchName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;master\u0026#39;}} }%% gitGraph commit commit branch v1.0 commit commit commit branch v1.1 commit commit commit tag:\u0026#34;v1.1:HEAD\u0026#34; checkout v1.0 commit tag:\u0026#34;v1.0:HEAD\u0026#34; checkout master commit tag:\u0026#34;master:HEAD\u0026#34; \u0026ldquo;Merging\u0026rdquo; Branches # The concept of merging binary data from different commits is complex. Ultimately, there are too many edge cases to do it reliably for every type of binary data, because computing a diff between two commits is ultimately meaningless unless you know how to compare the data. For example, we know that text files can be compared line-by-line or a bitmap image pixel by pixel, but how would we compute a diff for, say, binary model files?\nAdditionally, the output of a merge is usually a master copy, the official set of files desired. We rarely combine multiple pieces of image data to make one image, and if we are, we have usually created a technique for doing so. In the end, some files will be deleted, some updated, and some added.\nInstead, merging data, means creating a new commit with the desired combination of files and pointing our branch at that commit. In order to maintain a proper history, we would also want to make sure that the parent of that commit is relevant to what we want as well.\nFor example, in this situation, we have created a branch, dev, based on the 1-2833cd3 commit. We have committed multiple times to the dev branch, but nothing to master.\n%%{init: { \u0026#39;logLevel\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gitGraph\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;showBranches\u0026#39;: true, \u0026#39;showCommitLabel\u0026#39;:true,\u0026#39;mainBranchName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;master\u0026#39;}} }%% gitGraph commit id:\u0026#34;0-96e9b89\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;1-2833cd3\u0026#34; tag:\u0026#34;master:HEAD\u0026#34; branch dev commit id:\u0026#34;2-25a8daf\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;3-6413afc\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;4-41a750b\u0026#34; tag:\u0026#34;dev:HEAD\u0026#34; In this case it is simple to simply move the master branch to follow the most recent commit on dev, 4-41a750b.\npachctl create branch data@master --head 41a750b\nWhich would look like this:\n%%{init: { \u0026#39;logLevel\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gitGraph\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;showBranches\u0026#39;: true, \u0026#39;showCommitLabel\u0026#39;:true,\u0026#39;mainBranchName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;master\u0026#39;}} }%% gitGraph commit id:\u0026#34;0-96e9b89\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;1-2833cd3\u0026#34; branch dev commit id:\u0026#34;2-25a8daf\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;3-6413afc\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;4-41a750b\u0026#34; tag:\u0026#34;master:HEAD, dev:HEAD\u0026#34; Or from the history perspective of the respective branches:\n%%{init: { \u0026#39;logLevel\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gitGraph\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;showBranches\u0026#39;: true, \u0026#39;showCommitLabel\u0026#39;:true,\u0026#39;mainBranchName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;master\u0026#39;}} }%% gitGraph commit id:\u0026#34;0-96e9b89\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;1-2833cd3\u0026#34; branch dev commit id:\u0026#34;2-25a8daf\u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;3-6413afc\u0026#34; checkout dev commit tag:\u0026#34;dev:HEAD\u0026#34; id:\u0026#34;4-41a750b\u0026#34; checkout master commit id:\u0026#34;2-25a8daf \u0026#34; commit id:\u0026#34;3-6413afc \u0026#34; commit tag:\u0026#34;master:HEAD\u0026#34; id:\u0026#34;4-41a750b \u0026#34; Branches are useful for many reasons, but in Pachyderm they also form the foundation of the pipeline system.

		"body": " Introduction to Pipelines # The Pachyderm Pipeline System (PPS) is a powerful tool for automating data transformations. With PPS, pipelines can be automatically triggered whenever input data changes, meaning that data transformations happen automatically in response to changes in your data, without the need for manual intervention.\nPipelines in Pachyderm are defined by a pipeline specification and run on Kubernetes. The output of a pipeline is stored in a versioned data repository, which allows you to reproduce any transformation that occurs in Pachyderm.\nPipelines can be combined into a computational DAG (directed acyclic graph), with each pipeline being triggered when an upstream commit is finished. This allows you to build complex workflows that can process large amounts of data efficiently and with minimal manual intervention.\nPipeline Specification # This is a Pachyderm pipeline definition in YAML. It describes a pipeline called transform that takes data from the data repository and transforms it using a Python script my_transform_code.py.\npipeline: name: transform input: pfs: repo: data glob: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34; transform: image: my-transform-image:v1.0 cmd: - python - \u0026#34;/my_transform_code.py\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;--input\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;/pfs/data/\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;--output\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;/pfs/out/\u0026#34; Here\u0026rsquo;s a breakdown of the different sections of the pipeline definition:\npipeline specifies the name of the pipeline (in this case, it\u0026rsquo;s transform). This name will also be used as the name for the output data repository. input specifies the input for the pipeline. In this case, the input is taken from the data repository in Pachyderm. glob is used to specify how the files from the repository map to datums for processing. In this case, /* is used to specify all files in the repository can be processed individually. transform specifies the code and image to use for processing the input data. The image field specifies the Docker image to use for the pipeline. In this example, the image is named my-transform-image with a tag of v1.0. The cmd field specifies the command to run inside the container. In this example, the command is python /my_transform_code.py, which runs a Python script named my_transform_code.py. The script is passed the --input flag pointing to the input data directory, and the --output flag pointing to the output data directory. /pfs/data/ and /pfs/out/ are directories created by Pachyderm. The input directory will contain an individual datum when the job is running, and anything put into the output directory will be committed to the output repositories when the job is complete. So, in summary, this pipeline definition defines a pipeline called transform that takes all files in the data repository, runs a Python script to transform them, and outputs the results to the out repository.\nDatums and Jobs # Pipelines can distribute work across a cluster to parallelize computation. Each time data is committed to a Pachyderm repository, a job is created for each pipeline with that repo as an input to process the data.\nTo determine how to distribute data and computational work, datums are used. A datum is an indivisible unit of data required by the pipeline, defined according to the pipeline spec. The datums will be distributed across the cluster to be processed by workers.\nℹ️ Only one job per pipeline will be created per commit, but there may be many datums per job.\nFor example, say you have a bunch of images that you want to normalize to a single size. You could iterate through each image and use opencv to change the size of it. No image depends on any other image, so this task can be parallelized by treating each image as an individual unit of work, a datum.\nNext, let’s say you want to create a collage from those images. Now, we need to consider all of the images together to combine them. In this case, the collection of images would be a single datum, since they are all required for the process.\nPachyderm input specifications can handle both of these situations with the glob section of the Pipeline Specification.\nBasic Glob Patterns # In this section we\u0026rsquo;ll introduce glob patterns and datums in a couple of examples.\nIn the basic glob pattern example below, the input glob pattern is /*. This pattern matches each image at the top level of the images@master branch as an individual unit of work.\npipeline: name: resize description: A pipeline that resizes an image. input: pfs: glob: /* repo: images transform: cmd: - python - resize.py - --input - /pfs/images/* - --output - /pfs/out/ image: pachyderm/opencv When the pipeline is executed, it retrieves the datums defined in the input specification. For each datum, the worker downloads the necessary files into the Docker container at the start of its execution, and then performs the transform. Once the execution is complete, the output for each execution is combined into a commit and written to the output data repository.\nIn this example, the input glob pattern is /. This pattern matches everything at the top level of the images@master branch as an individual unit of work.\npipeline: name: collage description: A pipeline that creates a collage for a collection of images. input: pfs: glob: / repo: images transform: cmd: - python - collage.py - --input - /pfs/images/* - --output - /pfs/out/ image: pachyderm/opencv When this pipeline runs, it retrieves a single datum from the input specification. The job runs the single datum, downloading all the files from the images@master into the Docker container, and performs the transform. The result is then committed to the output data repository.\nAdvanced Glob Patterns # Datums can also be created from advanced operations, such as Join, Cross, Group, Union, and others to combine glob patterns from multiple data repositories. This allows us to create complex datum definitions, enabling sophisticated data processing pipelines.\nPipeline Communication (Advanced) # A much more detailed look at how Pachyderm actually triggers pipelines is shown in the sequence diagram below. This is a much more advanced level of detail, but knowing how the different pieces of the platform interact can be useful.\nBefore we look at the diagram, it may be helpful to provide a brief recap of the main participants involved:\nUser: The user is the person interacting with Pachyderm, typically through the command line interface (CLI) or one of the client libraries. PFS (Pachyderm File System): PFS is the underlying file system that stores all of the data in Pachyderm. It provides version control and lineage tracking for all data inside it. PPS (Pachyderm Pipeline System): PPS is how code gets applied to the data in Pachyderm. It manages the computational graph, which describes the dependencies between different steps of the data processing pipeline. Worker: Workers are Kubernetes pods that executes the jobs defined by PPS. Each worker runs a container image that contains the code for a specific pipeline. The worker will iterate through the datums it is given and apply user code to it. sequenceDiagram participant User participant PPS participant PFS participant Worker User-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PFS: pachctl create repo foo activate PFS Note over PFS: create branch foo@master deactivate PFS User-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PPS: pachctl create pipeline bar activate PPS PPS-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PFS: create branch bar@master \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; (provenant on foo@master) PPS-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Worker: create pipeline worker master Worker-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PFS: subscribe to bar@master \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; (because it\u0026#39;s subvenant on foo@master) deactivate PPS User-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PFS: pachctl put file -f foo@master data.txt activate PFS Note over PFS: start commit PFS-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PFS: propagate commit \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; (start downstream commits) Note over PFS: copy data.txt to open commit Note over PFS: finish commit PFS--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Worker: subscribed commit returns deactivate PFS Note over Worker: Pipeline Triggered activate Worker Worker-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PPS: Create job Worker-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PFS: request datums for commit PFS--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Worker: Datum list loop Each datum PFS-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Worker: download datum Note over Worker: Process datum with user code Worker-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PFS: copy data to open output commit end Worker-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PFS: Finish commit Worker-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;PPS: Finish job deactivate Worker This diagram illustrates the data flow and interaction between the user, the Pachyderm Pipeline System (PPS), the Pachyderm File System (PFS), and a worker node when creating and running a Pachyderm pipeline. Note, this is simplified for the single worker case. The multi-worker and autoscaling mechanisms are more complex.\nThe sequence of events begins with the user creating a PFS repo called foo and a PPS pipeline called bar with the foo repo as its input. When the pipeline is created, PPS creates a branch called bar@master, which is provenant on the foo@master branch in PFS. A worker pod is then created in the Kubernetes cluster by PPS, which subscribes to the bar@master branch.\nWhen the user puts a file named data.txt into the foo@master branch, PFS starts a new commit and propagates the commit, opening downstream commits for anything impacted. The worker receives the subscribed commit and when it finishes, triggers the pipeline.\nThe triggered pipeline creates a job for the pipeline, requesting datums for the output commit. For each datum, the worker downloads the data, processes it with the user\u0026rsquo;s code, and writes the output to an open output commit in PFS. Once all datums have been processed, the worker finishes the output commit and the job is marked as complete.\n",

For example, pach-resource-group. LOCATION An Azure availability zone where AKS is available. For example, centralus. NODE_SIZE The size of the Kubernetes virtual machine (VM) instances. To avoid performance issues, Pachyderm recommends that you set this value to at least Standard_DS4_v2 which gives you 8 CPUs, 28 Gib of Memory, 56 Gib SSD.\nIn any case, use VMs that support premium storage. See Azure VM sizes for details around which sizes support Premium storage. CLUSTER_NAME A unique name for the Pachyderm cluster. For example, pach-aks-cluster.

Some of the steps below will require you to keep updating the values.yaml started during the setup of the recommended infrastructure:\n2. Create a Storage Container # Pachyderm needs an Azure Storage Container (Object store) to store your data.\nTo access your data, Pachyderm uses a Storage Account with permissioned access to your desired container. You can either use an existing account or create a new one in your default subscription, then use the JSON key associated with the account and pass it on to Pachyderm.\nSet up the following variables:\nSTORAGE_ACCOUNT: The name of the storage account where you store your data. CONTAINER_NAME: The name of the Azure blob container where you store your data. Create an Azure storage account:\naz storage account create \\ --resource-group=\u0026#34;${RESOURCE_GROUP}\u0026#34; \\ --location=\u0026#34;${LOCATION}\u0026#34; \\ --sku=Premium_LRS \\ --name=\u0026#34;${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}\u0026#34; \\ --kind=BlockBlobStorage System response:\n{ \u0026#34;accessTier\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;creationTime\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2019-06-20T16:05:55.616832+00:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customDomain\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;enableAzureFilesAadIntegration\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;enableHttpsTrafficOnly\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;encryption\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;keySource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Microsoft.Storage\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;keyVaultProperties\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;services\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true, ... Make sure that you set Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) to Premium_LRS and the kind parameter is set to BlockBlobStorage. This configuration results in a storage that uses SSDs rather than standard Hard Disk Drives (HDD). If you set this parameter to an HDD-based storage option, your Pachyderm cluster will be too slow and might malfunction.\nVerify that your storage account has been successfully created:\naz storage account list Obtain the key for the storage account (STORAGE_ACCOUNT) and the resource group to be used to deploy Pachyderm:\nSTORAGE_KEY=\u0026#34;$(az storage account keys list \\ --account-name=\u0026#34;${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}\u0026#34; \\ --resource-group=\u0026#34;${RESOURCE_GROUP}\u0026#34; \\ --output=json \\ | jq \u0026#39;.[0].value\u0026#39; -r )\u0026#34; ℹ️ Find the generated key in the Storage accounts \u0026gt; Access keys section in the Azure Portal or by running the following command az storage account keys list --account-name=${STORAGE_ACCOUNT}.\nCreate a new storage container within your storage account:\naz storage container create --name ${CONTAINER_NAME} \\ --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT} \\ --account-key \u0026#34;${STORAGE_KEY}\u0026#34; 3.

Context # Pachyderm creates a Kubernetes cluster that you interact with using either the pachctl CLI or through Console, a GUI.\npachctl is great for users already experienced with using a CLI. Console is great for beginners and helps with visualizing relationships between projects, repos, and pipelines. Within the cluster, you can create projects that contain repos and pipelines. Pipelines can be single-stage or multi-stage; multi-stage pipelines are commonly referred to as DAGs.\nTutorial: Image processing with OpenCV # In this tutorial you\u0026rsquo;ll create an image edge detection pipeline that processes new data as it is added and outputs the results.\n1. Create a Project # To keep our work organized, we\u0026rsquo;re going to create a project named openCV and set it to our currently active context.\npachctl create project openCV pachctl config update context --project openCV You can always check to confirm which project has been set to your context by running the following commands:\n# prints current context name (local) pachctl config get active-context # prints local\u0026#39;s context details pachctl config get context local # { # \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;IMPORTED\u0026#34;, # \u0026#34;cluster_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;docker-desktop\u0026#34;, # \u0026#34;auth_info\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;docker-desktop\u0026#34;, # \u0026#34;cluster_deployment_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dev\u0026#34;, # \u0026#34;project\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;openCV\u0026#34; # } 2. Create a Repo # Repos should be dedicated to a single source of data such as log messages from a particular service, a users table, or training data.\npachctl create repo images You can verify that the repository was created by running the following command:\npachctl list repo # NAME CREATED SIZE (MASTER) ACCESS LEVEL # images 4 seconds ago ≤ 0B [repoOwner] 3. Add Data # In Pachyderm, you write data to an explicit commit. Commits are immutable snapshots of your data which give Pachyderm its version control properties. You can add, remove, or update files in a given commit.\nUpload an Image File # We\u0026rsquo;re going to use the pachctl put file command, along with the -f flag, to upload an image.\npachctl put file images@master:liberty.png -f http://imgur.com/46Q8nDz.png pachctl put file automatically starts and finishes a commit for you so you can add files more easily.\n💡 If you want to add many files over a period of time, you can do pachctl start commit and pachctl finish commit yourself.\nYou can confirm the commit using the following command:\npachctl list commit images # REPO BRANCH COMMIT FINISHED SIZE ORIGIN DESCRIPTION # openCV/images master 37559e89ed0c4a0cb354649524050851 10 seconds ago 57.27KiB USER You can also view the filename in the commit using the following command:\npachctl list file images@master # NAME TYPE SIZE # /liberty.png file 57.27KiB View Image # In Terminal # Operating System: MacOS Linux pachctl get file images@master:liberty.png | open -f -a Preview.app pachctl get file images@master:liberty.png | display In Console # In your Console, click on the images repo to visualize its commit and inspect its file:\n4.

Input data is stored in /pfs/\u0026lt;input_repo_name\u0026gt;. ℹ️ Your code must write out to /pfs/out (see the function make_edges(image) above). Pachyderm gathers data written to /pfs/out, versions it, and maps it to the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output repo of the same name.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s create the pipeline in Pachyderm:\npachctl create pipeline -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/2.5.x/examples/opencv/edges.json Again, check the end result in your Console: What Happens When You Create a Pipeline # When you create a pipeline, Pachyderm transforms all current and future data added to your input repo using your user code.

Let\u0026rsquo;s create a multi-stage pipeline (also known as a DAG) by adding a montage pipeline that takes our both original and edge-detected images and arranges them into a single montage of images:\nBelow is the pipeline spec for this new pipeline:\n{ \u0026#34;pipeline\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;montage\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;A pipeline that combines images from the `images` and `edges` repositories into a montage.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;cross\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;images\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;edges\u0026#34; } } ] }, \u0026#34;transform\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;cmd\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;sh\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;v4tech/imagemagick\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;stdin\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;montage -shadow -background SkyBlue -geometry 300x300+2+2 $(find /pfs -type f | sort) /pfs/out/montage.png\u0026#34; ] } } This montage pipeline spec is similar to our edges pipeline except for the following differences:\nWe are using a different Docker image that has imagemagick installed. We are executing a sh command with stdin instead of a python script in the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s transform section. We have multiple input data repositories (images and edges). In the montage pipeline we are combining our multiple input data repositories using a cross pattern. This cross pattern creates a single pairing of our input images with our edge detected images.\nCreate the montage pipeline: pachctl create pipeline -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/2.5.x/examples/opencv/montage.json View the triggered jobs: pachctl list job # ID SUBJOBS PROGRESS CREATED MODIFIED # 01e0c8040e18429daf7f67ce34c3a5d7 1 ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 11 seconds ago 11 seconds ago # 1c1a9d7d36944eabb4f6f14ebca25bf1 1 ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 12 minutes ago 12 minutes ago # fe5c4f70ac4347fd9c5934f0a9c44651 1 ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 12 minutes ago 12 minutes ago # 23378d899d3d45738f55df3809841145 1 ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 24 minutes ago 24 minutes ago View the generated montage image: Operating System: MacOS Linux pachctl get file montage@master:montage.png | open -f -a Preview.app pachctl get file montage@master:montage.png | display ",

		"body": "While a Pachyderm pipeline is running, it processes any new data that you commit to its input branch. However, in some cases, you want to commit data more frequently than you want to process it.\nBecause Pachyderm pipelines do not reprocess the data that has already been processed, in most cases, this is not an issue. But, some pipelines might need to process everything from scratch. For example, you might want to commit data every hour, but only want to retrain a machine learning model on that data daily because it needs to train on all the data from scratch.\nIn these cases, you can leverage a massive performance benefit from deferred processing. This section covers how to achieve that and control what gets processed.\nPachyderm controls what is being processed by using the filesystem, rather than at the pipeline level. Although pipelines are inflexible, they are simple and always try to process the data at the heads of their input branches. In contrast, the filesystem is very flexible and gives you the ability to commit data in different places and then efficiently move and rename the data so that it gets processed when you want.\nConfigure a Staging Branch in an Input repository # When you want to load data into Pachyderm without triggering a pipeline, you can upload it to a staging branch and then submit accumulated changes in one batch by re-pointing the HEAD of your master branch to a commit in the staging branch.\nAlthough, in this section, the branch in which you consolidate changes is called staging, you can name it as you like.\nℹ️ You can have multiple staging branches. For example, dev1, dev2, staging\u0026hellip;\nIn the example below, we first create a repository called data on which we configure a staging branch:\n💡 A simple pipeline subscribes to the master branch of the repo data:\n{ \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;branch\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;master\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34;, } } Create a repository. For example, data.\npachctl create repo data Create a master branch.\npachctl create branch data@master View the created branch:\npachctl list commit data REPO BRANCH COMMIT FINISHED SIZE ORIGIN DESCRIPTION data master 8090bfb4d4fe44158eac12199c37a591 About a minute ago 0B AUTO Pachyderm automatically created an empty HEAD commit on the new branch, as you can see from the zero-byte size and AUTO commit origin. When you commit data to the master branch, the pipeline immediately starts a job to process it. However, if you want to commit something without immediately processing it, you need to commit it to a different branch.\nCommit a file to the staging branch:\npachctl put file data@staging -f \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; Pachyderm automatically creates the staging branch. Your repo now has 2 branches, staging and master. In this example, the staging name is used, but you can name the branch as you want.\nVerify that the branches were created:\npachctl list branch data BRANCH HEAD TRIGGER staging f3506f0fab6e483e8338754081109e69 - master 8090bfb4d4fe44158eac12199c37a591 - The master branch still has the same HEAD commit. No jobs have started to process the new file, because there are no pipelines that take staging as inputs. You can continue to commit to staging to add new data to the branch, and the pipeline will not process anything.\nWhen you are ready to process the data, update the master branch to point it to the head of the staging branch:\npachctl create branch data@master --head staging List your branches to verify that the master branch\u0026rsquo;s HEAD commit has changed:\npachctl list branch data staging f3506f0fab6e483e8338754081109e69 master f3506f0fab6e483e8338754081109e69 The master and staging branches now have the same HEAD commit. This means that your pipeline has data to process.\nVerify that the pipeline has new jobs:\npachctl list job test@f3506f0fab6e483e8338754081109e69 ID PIPELINE STARTED DURATION RESTART PROGRESS DL UL STATE f3506f0fab6e483e8338754081109e69 test 32 seconds ago Less than a second 0 6 + 0 / 6 108B 24B success You should see one job that Pachyderm created for all the changes you have submitted to the staging branch, with the same ID. While the commits to the staging branch are ancestors of the current HEAD in master, they were never the actual HEAD of master themselves, so they do not get processed. This behavior works for most of the use cases because commits in Pachyderm are generally additive, so processing the HEAD commit also processes data from previous commits.\nProcess Specific Commits # Sometimes you want to process specific intermediary commits that are not in the HEAD of the branch. To do this, you need to set master to have these commits as HEAD. For example, if you submitted ten commits in the staging branch and you want to process the seventh, third, and most recent commits, you need to run the following commands respectively:\npachctl create branch data@master --head staging^7 pachctl create branch data@master --head staging^3 pachctl create branch data@master --head staging When you run the commands above, Pachyderm creates a job for each of the commands one after another. Therefore, when one job is completed, Pachyderm starts the next one. To verify that Pachyderm created jobs for these commands, run pachctl list job -p \u0026lt;pipeline_name\u0026gt; --history all.\nChange the HEAD of your Branch # You can move backward to previous commits as easily as advancing to the latest commits. For example, if you want to change the final output to be the result of processing staging^1, you can roll back your HEAD commit by running the following command:\npachctl create branch data@master --head staging^1 This command starts a new job to process staging^1. The HEAD commit on your output repo will be the result of processing staging^1 instead of staging.\nCopy Files from One Branch to Another # Using a staging branch allows you to defer processing. To use this functionality you need to know your input commits in advance. However, sometimes you want to be able to commit data in an ad-hoc, disorganized manner and then organize it later. Instead of pointing your master branch to a commit in a staging branch, you can copy individual files from staging to master. When you run copy file, Pachyderm only copies references to the files and does not move the actual data for the files around.\nTo copy files from one branch to another, complete the following steps:\nStart a commit:\npachctl start commit data@master Copy files:\npachctl copy file data@staging:file1 data@master:file1 pachctl copy file data@staging:file2 data@master:file2 ... Close the commit:\npachctl finish commit data@master ℹ️ While the commit is open, you can run pachctl delete file if you want to remove something from the parent commit or pachctl put file if you want to upload something that is not in a repo yet.\nDeferred Processing in Output Repositories # You can perform the same deferred processing operations with data in output repositories. To do so, rather than committing to a staging branch, configure the output_branch field in your pipeline specification.\nTo configure deferred processing in an output repository, complete the following steps:\nIn the pipeline specification, add the output_branch field with the name of the branch in which you want to accumulate your data before processing:\n\u0026#34;output_branch\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;staging\u0026#34; When you want to process data, run:\npachctl create branch pipeline@master --head staging Automate Deferred Processing With Branch Triggers # Typically, repointing from one branch to another happens when a certain condition is met. For example, you might want to repoint your branch when you have a specific number of commits, or when the amount of unprocessed data reaches a certain size, or at a specific time interval, such as daily, or other. This can be automated using branch triggers. A trigger is a relationship between two branches, such as master and staging in the examples above, that says: when the head commit of staging meets a certain condition it should trigger master to update its head to that same commit. In other words it does pachctl create branch data@master --head staging automatically when the trigger condition is met.\nBuilding on the example above, to make master automatically trigger when there\u0026rsquo;s 1 Megabyte of new data on staging, run:\npachctl create branch data@master --trigger staging --trigger-size 1MB pachctl list branch data BRANCH HEAD TRIGGER staging 8b5f3eb8dc4346dcbd1a547f537982a6 - master 8090bfb4d4fe44158eac12199c37a591 staging on Size(1MB) When you run that command, it may or may not set the head of master. It depends on the difference between the size of the head of staging and the existing head of master, or 0 if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Notice that in the example above staging had an existing head with less than a MB of data in it so master is still empty. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see staging when you list branch that\u0026rsquo;s ok, triggers can point to branches that don\u0026rsquo;t exist yet. The head of master will update if you add a MB of new data to staging:\ndd if=/dev/urandom bs=1MiB count=1 | pachctl put file data@staging:/file pachctl list branch data BRANCH HEAD TRIGGER staging 64b70e6aeda84845858c42d755023673 - master 64b70e6aeda84845858c42d755023673 staging on Size(1MB) Triggers automate deferred processing, but they don\u0026rsquo;t prevent manually updating the head of a branch. If you ever want to trigger master even though the trigger condition hasn\u0026rsquo;t been met you can run:\npachctl create branch data@master --head staging Notice that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to re-specify the trigger when you call create branch to change the head. If you do want to clear the trigger delete the branch and recreate it.\nThere are three conditions on which you can trigger the repointing of a branch.\ntime, using a cron specification (\u0026ndash;trigger-cron) size (\u0026ndash;trigger-size) number of commits (\u0026ndash;trigger-commits) When more than one is specified, a branch repoint will be triggered when any of the conditions is met. To guarantee that they all must be met, add \u0026ndash;trigger-all.\nTo experiment further, see the full triggers example.\nEmbed Triggers in Pipelines # Triggers can also be specified in the pipeline spec and automatically created when the pipeline is created. For example, this is the edges pipeline from our our OpenCV demo modified to only trigger when there is a 1 Megabyte of new images:\n{ \u0026#34;pipeline\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;edges\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;A pipeline that performs image edge detection by using the OpenCV library.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;images\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;trigger\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1MB\u0026#34; } } }, \u0026#34;transform\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;cmd\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;python3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/edges.py\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pachyderm/opencv\u0026#34; } } When you create this pipeline, Pachyderm will also create a branch in the input repo that specifies the trigger and the pipeline will use that branch as its input. The name of the branch is auto-generated with the form \u0026lt;pipeline-name\u0026gt;-trigger-n. You can manually update the heads of these branches to trigger processing just like in the previous example.\nℹ️ Deleting or updating a pipeline will not clean up the trigger branch that it has created. In fact, the trigger branch has a lifetime that is not tied to the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s lifetime. There is no guarantee that other pipelines are not using that trigger branch. A trigger branch can, however, be deleted manually (pachctl delete branch \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;).\nMore advanced automation # More advanced use cases might not be covered by the trigger methods above. For those, you need to create a Kubernetes application that uses Pachyderm APIs and watches the repositories for the specified condition. When the condition is met, the application switches the Pachyderm branch from staging to master.\n",

		"body": "Distributing your computations across multiple workers is a fundamental part of any big data processing. When you build production-scale pipelines, you need to adjust the number of workers and resources that are allocated to each job to optimize throughput.\nA Pachyderm worker is an identical Kubernetes pod that runs the Docker image that you specified in the pipeline spec. Your analysis code does not affect how Pachyderm distributes the workload among workers. Instead, Pachyderm spreads out the data that needs to be processed across the various workers and makes that data available for your code.\nWhen you create a pipeline, Pachyderm spins up worker pods that continuously run in the cluster waiting for new data to be available for processing. You can change this behavior by setting \u0026quot;autoscaling\u0026quot; :true. Therefore, you do not need to recreate and schedule workers for every new job.\nFor each job, all the datums are queued up and then distributed across the available workers. When a worker finishes processing its datum, it grabs a new datum from the queue until all the datums complete processing. If a worker pod crashes, its datums are redistributed to other workers for maximum fault tolerance.\nThe following animation shows how distributed computing works:\nIn the diagram above, you have three Pachyderm worker pods that process your data. When a pod finishes processing a datum, it automatically takes another datum from the queue to process it. Datums might be different in size and, therefore, some of them might be processed faster than others.\nEach datum goes through the following processing phases inside a Pachyderm worker pod:\nPhase Description Downloading The Pachyderm worker pod downloads the datum contents into Pachyderm. Processing The Pachyderm worker pod runs the contents of the datum against your code. Uploading The Pachyderm worker pod uploads the results of processing into an output repository. When a datum completes a phase, the Pachyderm worker moves it to the next one while another datum from the queue takes its place in the processing sequence.\nThe following animation displays what happens inside a pod during the datum processing:\nParallelism # You can control the number of worker pods that Pachyderm runs in a pipeline by defining the parallelism parameter in the pipeline specification.\nexample # \u0026#34;parallelism_spec\u0026#34;: { // Exactly one of these two fields should be set \u0026#34;constant\u0026#34;: int Pachyderm has the following parallelism strategies that you can set in the pipeline spec:\nStrategy Description constant Pachyderm starts the specified number of workers. For example, if you set \u0026quot;constant\u0026quot;:10, Pachyderm spreads the computation workload among ten workers. By default, Pachyderm sets parallelism to “constant\u0026quot;: 1, which means that it spawns one worker per Kubernetes node for this pipeline.\nAutoscaling # Pipelines that will not have a constant flow of data to process should use the autoscaling feature by setting \u0026quot;autoscaling\u0026quot;: true in the pipeline spec.\nDoing so will cause the pipeline to go into standby when there is nothing for the workers to do. In standby a pipeline will have no workers and will consume no resources; it will just wait for data to come in for it to process.\nWhen data does come in, the pipeline will exit its standby status and spin up workers to process the new data. Initially, a single worker will spin up and layout a distributed processing plan for the job. Then it will start working on the job, and if there is more work that could happen in parallel, it will spin up more workers to run in parallel, up to the limit defined by the parallelism_spec.\nMultiple jobs can run in parallel and cause new workers to spin up. For example, if a job comes in with a single datum, it will cause a single worker to spin up. If another job with a single datum comes in while the first job is still running, another worker will spin up to work on the second job. Again this is bounded by the limit defined in the parallelism_spec.\nOne limitation of autoscaling is that it cannot dynamically scale down. Suppose a job with many datums is near completion, only one worker is still working while the others are idle. Pachyderm does not yet have a way for the idle workers to steal work, and there are a few issues that prevent us from spinning down the idle workers. Kubernetes does not have a good way to scale down a controller and specify which pods should be killed, so scaling down may kill the worker pod that is still doing work. This means another worker will have to restart that work from scratch, and the job will take longer. Additionally, we want to keep the workers around to participate in the distributed merge process at the end of the job.\nℹ️ See Also:\nGlob Pattern Pipeline Specification ",

		"body": " Definition # Pachyderm provides users with a simple way to follow a change throughout their DAG (i.e., traverse Provenance and Subvenance).\nPachyderm associates a commit ID to each new commit. You can quickly check this new commit by running pachctl list commit repo@branch. All resulting downstream commits and jobs in your DAG will then share that same ID (Global Identifier).\n📖 The commits and jobs sharing the same ID represent a logically-related set of objects. The ID of a commit is also:\nthe ID of any commits created along due to provenance relationships, and the ID of any jobs triggered by the creation of those commits. This ability to track down related commits and jobs with one global identifier brought the need to introduce a new scope to our original concepts of job and commit. The nuance in the scope of a commit or a job ( \u0026ldquo;Global\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Local\u0026rdquo;) gives the term two possible meanings.\nCONCEPT SCOPE DEFINITION Commit Global A commit with global scope (global commit) represents the set of all provenance-dependent commits sharing the same ID. You can retrieve a global commit by running pachctl list commit \u0026lt;commitID\u0026gt;. Commit Local Repo The same term of commit, applied to the more focused scope of a repo (pachctl list commit \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;commitID\u0026gt; or pachctl list commit \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;commitID\u0026gt;), represents \u0026ldquo;the Git-like\u0026rdquo; record of one commit in a single branch of a repository\u0026rsquo;s file system. Job Global A job with global scope (global job) is the set of jobs triggered due to commits in a global commit.\nYou can retrieve a global job by running pachctl list job \u0026lt;commitID\u0026gt;. Job Local Pipeline Narrowing down the scope to a single pipeline (pachctl list job \u0026lt;pipeline\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;commitID\u0026gt;) shifts the meaning to the execution of a given job in a pipeline of your DAG. List All Global Commits And Global Jobs # You can list all global commits by running the following command:\npachctl list commit Each global commit displays how many (sub) commits it is made of.\nID SUBCOMMITS PROGRESS CREATED MODIFIED 1035715e796f45caae7a1d3ffd1f93ca 7 ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 7 seconds ago 7 seconds ago 28363be08a8f4786b6dd0d3b142edd56 6 ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 24 seconds ago 24 seconds ago e050771b5c6f4082aed48a059e1ac203 4 ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 24 seconds ago 24 seconds ago Similarly, if you run the equivalent command for global jobs:\npachctl list job you will notice that the job IDs are shared with the global commit IDs.\nID SUBJOBS PROGRESS CREATED MODIFIED 1035715e796f45caae7a1d3ffd1f93ca 2 ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ 55 seconds ago 55 seconds ago 28363be08a8f4786b6dd0d3b142edd56 1 ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ About a minute ago About a minute ago e050771b5c6f4082aed48a059e1ac203 1 ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ About a minute ago About a minute ago For example, in this example, 7 commits and 2 jobs are involved in the changes occured in the global commit ID 1035715e796f45caae7a1d3ffd1f93ca.\nℹ️ The progress bar is equally divided to the number of steps, or pipelines, you have in your DAG.

		"body": " ℹ️ TLDR: Datums define what input data is seen by your code. It can be all data at once, each directory independently, individual files one by one, or combined data from multiple inputs together.\nDefinition # A datum is the smallest indivisible unit of computation within a job. A job can have one, many or no datums. Each datum is processed independently with a single execution of the user code on one of the pipeline worker pods. The files output by all of the datums are then combined together to create the final output commit.\nZero-Datum Jobs # A \u0026ldquo;zero-datum\u0026rdquo; job is a job that is successfully executed but has no matching files to transform with the provided user code.\nData distribution # Think of datums as a way to divide your input data and distribute processing workloads. They are instrumental in optimizing your pipeline performance.\nYou define how your data is spread among workers by specifying pipeline inputs for your pipeline in its pipeline specification file.\nBased on this specification file, the data in the input of your pipeline is turned into datums, each of which can contain 1-to-many files. Pachyderm provides a wide variety of ways to define the granularity of each datum.\nFor example, you can configure a whole branch of an input repository to be one datum, each top-level filesystem object of a given branch to be a separate datum, specific paths on a given branch can be datums, etc\u0026hellip; You can also create a combination of the above by aggregating multiple input.\nPipeline Inputs # This section details the tools at your disposal to \u0026ldquo;break down\u0026rdquo; your data and fit your specific use case.\nPFS Input and Glob Pattern # The most primitive input of a pipeline is a PFS input, defined, at a minimum, by:\na repo containing the data you want your pipeline to consider a branch to watch for commits and a glob pattern to determine how the input data is partitioned. A pipeline input can have one or multiple PFS inputs. In the latter case, Pachyderm provides a variety of options to aggregate several PFS inputs together.\n",

		"body": "Pachyderm enables you to combine multiple PFS inputs by using the union and cross operators in the pipeline specification.\nYou can think of union as a disjoint union binary operator and cross as a cartesian product binary operator.\nThis section describes how to use cross and union in your pipelines and how you can optimize your code when you work with them.\nUnion Input # The union input combines each of the datums in the input repos as one set of datums. The number of datums that are processed is the sum of all the datums in each repo.\nFor example, you have two input repos, A and B. Each of these repositories contain three files with the following names.\nRepository A has the following structure:\nA ├── 1.txt ├── 2.txt └── 3.txt Repository B has the following structure:\nB ├── 4.txt ├── 5.txt └── 6.txt If you want your pipeline to process each file independently as a separate datum, use a glob pattern of /*. Each glob is applied to each input independently. The input section in the pipeline spec might have the following structure:\n\u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;union\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;A\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;B\u0026#34; } } ] } In this example, each Pachyderm repository has those three files in the root directory, so three datums from each input. Therefore, the union of A and B has six datums in total. Your pipeline processes the following datums without any specific order:\n/pfs/A/1.txt /pfs/A/2.txt /pfs/A/3.txt /pfs/B/4.txt /pfs/B/5.txt /pfs/B/6.txt ℹ️ Each datum in a pipeline is processed independently by a single execution of your code. In this example, your code runs six times, and each datum is available to it one at a time. For example, your code processes pfs/A/1.txt in one of the runs and pfs/B/5.txt in a different run, and so on. In a union, two or more datums are never available to your code at the same time. You can simplify your union code by using the name property as described below.\nSimplifying the Union Pipelines Code # In the example above, your code needs to read into the pfs/A or pfs/B directory because only one of them is present in any given datum. To simplify your code, you can add the name field to the pfs object and give the same name to each of the input repos. For example, you can add, the name field with the value C to the input repositories A and B:\n\u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;union\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;A\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;B\u0026#34; } } ] } Then, in the pipeline, all datums appear in the same directory.\n/pfs/C/1.txt # from A /pfs/C/2.txt # from A /pfs/C/3.txt # from A /pfs/C/4.txt # from B /pfs/C/5.txt # from B /pfs/C/6.txt # from B Cross Input # In a cross input, Pachyderm exposes every combination of datums, or a cross-product, from each of your input repositories to your code in a single run.\nIn other words, a cross input pairs every datum in one repository with each datum in another, creating sets of datums. Your transformation code is provided one of these sets at the time to process.\nFor example, you have repositories A and B with three datums, each with the following structure:\nℹ️ For this example, the glob pattern is set to /*.\nRepository A has three files at the top level:\nA ├── 1.txt ├── 2.txt └── 3.txt Repository B has three files at the top level:\nB ├── 4.txt ├── 5.txt └── 6.txt Because you have three datums in each repo, Pachyderm exposes a total of nine combinations of datums to your code.\n💡 In cross pipelines, both pfs/A and pfs/B directories are visible during each code run.\nRun 1: /pfs/A/1.txt /pfs/B/4.txt Run 2: /pfs/A/1.txt /pfs/B/5.txt ... Run 9: /pfs/A/3.txt /pfs/B/6.txt ℹ️ In cross inputs, if you use the name field, your two inputs cannot have the same name. This could cause file system collisions.\nℹ️ See Also:\nCross Input in a pipeline specification Union Input in a pipeline specification Distributed hyperparameter tuning example ",

		"body": "A datum is a Pachyderm abstraction that helps in optimizing pipeline processing. Datums exist only as a pipeline processing property and are not filesystem objects. You can never copy a datum. They are a representation of a unit of work.\nJob Processing and Datums # When new data comes in (in the form of commit(s) in its input repo(s)), a Pachyderm pipeline automatically starts a new job. Each Pachyderm job consists of the following stages:\n1: Creation of input datums # In this stage, Pachyderm creates datums based on the input data according to the pipeline input(s) set in the pipeline specification file.\n2: Transformation # The pipeline uses your code to process the datums.\n3: Creation of output files # Your code writes output file(s) in the pfs/out output directory that Pachyderm creates automatically for each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s job.\n4: Final commit in the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output repo # ℹ️ The output produced by a pipeline\u0026rsquo;s job is written to an output repo of the same name (i.e., output repo name = pipeline name).\nThe content of all /pfs/out is combined in a commit to the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output repo. This generally means unioning all the files together.\n💡 The Single Datum Provenance Rule.\nIf two outputted files have the same name (i.e., two datums wrote to the same output file, creating a conflict), then an error is raised, resulting in your pipeline failure.\nAvoid this anti-pattern from the start by having each datum write in separate files. Pachyderm provides an environment variable PACH_DATUM_ID that stores the datum ID. This variable is available in the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s user code. To ensure that each datum outputs distinct file paths, you can use this variable in the name of your outputted files.\n5. Next: Add a Reduce (Merge) pipeline # If you need files from different datums merged into single files in a particular way:\nadd a pipeline that groups the files from the previous output repo into single datums using the appropriate glob pattern. then merge them as intended using your code. The example that follows illustrates this two steps approach.\nExample: Two Steps Map/Reduce Pattern and Single Datum Provenance Rule # In this example, we highlight a two pipelines pattern where a first pipeline\u0026rsquo;s glob pattern splits an incoming commit into three datums (called \u0026ldquo;Datum1\u0026rdquo; (Red), \u0026ldquo;Datum2\u0026rdquo; (Blue), \u0026ldquo;Datum3\u0026rdquo; (Purple)), each producing two files each. The files can then be further appended or overwritten with other files to create the final result. Below, a second pipeline appends the content of all files in each directory into one final document.\nℹ️ In the example, the files are named after the datum itself. Depending on your use case, there might be more logical ways to name the files produced by a datum. However, in any case, make sure that this name is unique for each datum to avoid duplicate files with the same file path. Each file is put in specific directories. This directory structure has been thought to facilitate the aggregation of the content in the following pipeline. Think about your directory structure so that the next glob pattern will aggregate your data as needed. Let\u0026rsquo;s now create a new commit and overwrite a file in datum 2, Pachyderm detects three datums. However, because datum 1 and datum 3 are unchanged, it skips processing these datums. Pachyderm detects that something has changed in datum 2. It is unaware of any details of the change; therefore, it processes the whole datum 2(') (here in yellow) and outputs 3 files. Then, the following pipeline aggregates these data to create the final result.\nIncrementality # In Pachyderm, unchanged datums are never re-processed. For example, if you have multiple datums, and only one datum was modified; Pachyderm processes that datum only and skips processing other datums. This incremental behavior ensures efficient resource utilization.\nOverwriting files # By default, Pachyderm overwrites new data. For example, if you have a file foo in the repository A and add the same file foo to that repository again by using the pachctl put file command, Pachyderm will overwrite that file in the repo.\nFor more information, and learn how to change this behavior, see File.\nNote: Data persistence between datums # Pachyderm only controls and wipes the /pfs directories between datums. If scratch/temp space is used during execution, the user needs to be careful to clean that up. Not cleaning temporary directories may cause unexpected bugs where one datum accesses temporary files that were previously used by another datum!\n",

		"body": "Defining how your data is spread among workers is one of the most important aspects of distributed computation.\nPachyderm uses glob patterns to provide flexibility to define data distribution.\nℹ️ Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s concept of glob patterns is similar to Unix glob patterns. For example, the ls *.md command matches all files with the .md file extension.\nThe glob pattern applies to all of the directories/files in the branch specified by the pfs section of the pipeline specification (referred to as PFS inputs). The directories/files that match are the datums that will be processed by the worker(s) that run your pipeline code.\n⚠️ You must configure a glob pattern for each PFS input of a pipeline specification.\nWe have listed some commonly used glob patterns. We will later illustrate their use in an example:\nGlob Pattern Datum created / Pachyderm denotes the whole repository as a single datum and sends all input data to a single worker node to be processed together. /* Pachyderm defines each top-level files / directories in the input repo, as a separate datum. For example, if you have a repository with ten files and no directory structure, Pachyderm identifies each file as a single datum and processes them independently. /*/* Pachyderm processes each file / directory in each subdirectories as a separate datum. /** Pachyderm processes each file in all directories and subdirectories as a separate datum. Glob patterns also let you take only a particular subset of the files / directories, a specific branch\u0026hellip; as an input instead of the whole repo. We will elaborate on this more in the following example.\nIf you have more than one input repo in your pipeline, or want to consider more than one branch in a repo, or any combination of the above, you can define a different glob pattern for each PFS input. You can additionally combine the resulting datums by using the cross, union, join, or group operator to create the final datums that your code processes. For more information, see Cross and Union, Join, Group.\nExample of Defining Datums # Let\u0026rsquo;s consider an input repo with the following structure where each top-level directory represents a US state with a json file for each city in that state:\n/California /San-Francisco.json /Los-Angeles.json ... /Colorado /Denver.json /Boulder.json ... /Washington /Seattle.json /Vancouver.json Now let\u0026rsquo;s consider what the following glob patterns would match respectively:\nGlob Pattern Corresponding match Example / This pattern matches /, the root directory itself, meaning all the data would be one large datum. All changes in any of the files and directories trigger Pachyderm to process the whole repository contents as a single datum. If you add a new file Sacramento.json to the California/ directory, Pachyderm processes all changed files and directories in the repo as a single datum. /* This pattern matches everything under the root directory. It defines one datum per state, which means that all the cities for a given state are processed together by a single worker, but each state is processed independently. If you add a new file Sacramento.json to the California/ directory, Pachyderm processes the California/ datum only. /Colorado/* This pattern matches files only under the /Colorado directory. It defines one datum per city. If you add a new file Alamosa.json to the Colorado/ directory and Sacramento.json to the California/ directory, Pachyderm processes the Alamosa.json datum only. /C* This pattern matches all files under the root directory that start with the character C. In the example, the California and Colorado directories will each define a datum. /*/* This pattern matches everything that\u0026rsquo;s two levels deep relative to the root. If we add County sub-directories to our states, /California/LosAngeles/LosAngeles.json, /California/LosAngeles/Malibu.json and /California/SanDiego/LaMosa.json for example, then this pattern would match each of those 3 .json files individually. /** The match is applied at all levels of your directory structure. This is a recursive glob pattern. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the additional example below for more detail. Example # The case of the /** glob pattern\nSay we have the following repo structure:\n/nope1.txt /test1.txt /foo-1 /nope2.txt /test2.txt /foo-2 /foo-2_1 /nope3.txt /test3.txt /anothertest.txt \u0026hellip;and apply the following pattern to our input repo:\n\u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/**test*.txt\u0026#34; We are recursively matching all .txt files containing test starting from our input repo\u0026rsquo;s root directory. In this case, the resulting datums will be:\n- /test1.txt - /foo-1/test2.txt - /foo-2/foo-2_1/test3.txt - /foo-2/foo-2_1/anothertest.txt 📖 To understand how Pachyderm scales, read Distributed Computing. To learn about Datums\u0026rsquo; incremental processing, read our Datum Processing section. Test a Glob pattern # You can use the pachctl glob file command to preview which filesystem objects a pipeline defines as datums. This command helps you to test various glob patterns before you use them in a pipeline.\nIf you set the glob property to /, Pachyderm detects all top-level filesystem objects in the train repository as one datum:\nExample # pachctl glob file train@master:/ System Response:\nNAME TYPE SIZE / dir 15.11KiB If you set the glob property to /*, Pachyderm detects each top-level filesystem object in the train repository as a separate datum:\nExample # pachctl glob file train@master:/* System Response:\nNAME TYPE SIZE /IssueSummarization.py file 1.224KiB /requirements.txt file 74B /seq2seq_utils.py file 13.81KiB Test your Datums # The granularity of your datums defines how your data will be distributed across the available workers allocated to a job. Pachyderm allows you to check those datums:\nfor a pipeline currently being developed for a past job Testing your glob pattern before creating a pipeline # You can use the pachctl list datum -f \u0026lt;my_pipeline_spec.json\u0026gt; command to preview the datums defined by a pipeline given its specification file.\nℹ️ The pipeline does not need to have been created for the command to return the list of datums. This \u0026ldquo;dry run\u0026rdquo; helps you adjust your glob pattern when creating your pipeline.\nExample # pachctl list datum -f edges.json System Response:\nID FILES STATUS TIME - images@b8687e9720f04b7ab53ae8c64541003b:/46Q8nDz.jpg - - - images@b8687e9720f04b7ab53ae8c64541003b:/8MN9Kg0.jpg - - - images@b8687e9720f04b7ab53ae8c64541003b:/Togu2RY.jpg - - - images@b8687e9720f04b7ab53ae8c64541003b:/g2QnNqa.jpg - - - images@b8687e9720f04b7ab53ae8c64541003b:/w7RVTsv.jpg - - Running list datum on a past job # You can use the pachctl list datum \u0026lt;pipeline\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;job_ID\u0026gt; command to check the datums processed by a given job.\nExample # pachctl list datum edges@b8687e9720f04b7ab53ae8c64541003b System Response:\nID FILES STATUS TIME a4149cd1907145f982e0eb49c50af3f1d4d8fecaa8647d62f2d9d93e30578df8 images@b8687e9720f04b7ab53ae8c64541003b:/w7RVTsv.jpg success Less than a second e2b4628dd88b179051ba0576e06fac12ae2e4d16165296212d0e98de501d17df images@b8687e9720f04b7ab53ae8c64541003b:/Togu2RY.jpg success Less than a second 353b6d2a5ac78f56facc7979e190affbb8f75c6f74da84b758216a8df77db473 images@7856142de8714c11b004610ea7af2378:/8MN9Kg0.jpg skipped Less than a second b751702850acad5502dc51c3e7e7a1ac10ba2199fdb839989cd0c5430ee10b84 images@fc9a12ee149a4499a1a7da0a31971b37:/46Q8nDz.jpg skipped Less than a second de9e3703322eff2ab90e89ff01a18c448af9870f17e78438c5b0f56588af9c44 images@7856142de8714c11b004610ea7af2378:/g2QnNqa.jpg skipped Less than a second In this example, you can see that the job b8687e9720f04b7ab53ae8c64541003b only processed 2 datums from the images input repo.

		"body": "A group is a special type of pipeline input that enables you to aggregate files that reside in one or separate Pachyderm repositories and match a particular naming pattern. The group operator must be used in combination with a glob pattern that reflects a specific naming convention.\nBy analogy, a Pachyderm group is similar to a database group-by, but it matches on file paths only, not the content of the files.\nUnlike the join datum that will always contain a single match (even partial) from each input repo, a group creates one datum for each set of matching files accross its input repos. You can use group to aggregate data that is not adequately captured by your directory structure or to control the granularity of your datums through file name-matching.\nWhen you configure a group input, you must specify a glob pattern that includes a capture group. The capture group defines the specific string in the file path that is used to match files in other grouped repos. Capture groups work analogously to the regex capture group. You define the capture group inside parenthesis. Capture groups are numbered from left to right and can also be nested within each other. Numbering for nested capture groups is based on their opening parenthesis.\nBelow you can find a few examples of applying a glob pattern with a capture group to a file path. For example, if you have the following file path:\n/foo/bar-123/ABC.txt The following glob patterns in a joint input create the following capture groups:\nRegular expression Capture groups /(*) foo /*/bar-(*) 123 /(*)/*/(??)*.txt Capture group 1: foo, capture group 2: AB. /*/(bar-(123))/* Capture group 1: bar-123, capture group 2: 123. Also, groups require you to specify a replacement group in the group_by parameter to define which capture groups you want to try to match.\nFor example, $1 indicates that you want Pachyderm to match based on capture group 1. Similarly, $2 matches the capture group 2. $1$2 means that it must match both capture groups 1 and 2.\nIf Pachyderm does not find any matching files, you get a zero-datum job.\nYou can test your glob pattern and capture groups by using the pachctl list datum -f \u0026lt;your_pipeline_spec.json\u0026gt; command as described in List Datum.\n💡 The content of the capture group defined in the group_by parameter is available to your pipeline\u0026rsquo;s code in an environment variable: PACH_DATUM_\u0026lt;input.name\u0026gt;_GROUP_BY.\nExample # For example, a repository labresults contains the lab results of patients.

The join operator must be used in combination with a glob pattern that reflects a specific naming convention. Note that in Pachyderm, matches are made on file paths only, not the files\u0026rsquo; content.\nPachyderm supports two types of joins:\nA default join setting, similar to a database equi-join or inner-join operation. Unlike the cross input, which creates datums from every combination of files in each input repository, inner joins only create datums where there is a match. You can use inner joins to combine data from different Pachyderm repositories and ensure that only specific files from each repo are processed together. If Pachyderm does not find any matching files, you get a zero-datum job. Pachyderm also supports a join close to a database outer-join, allowing you to create datums for all files in a repo, even if there is no match. The outer-join behavior can be set on any repository in your join. When you configure a join input (inner or outer), you must specify a glob pattern that includes a capture group. The capture group defines the specific string in the file path that is used to match files in other joined repos. Capture groups work analogously to the regex capture group. You define the capture group inside parenthesis. Capture groups are numbered from left to right and can also be nested within each other.

Also, joins require you to specify a replacement group in the join_on parameter to define which capture groups you want to try to match.\nFor example, $1 indicates that you want Pachyderm to match based on capture group 1. Similarly, $2 matches the capture group 2. $1$2 means that it must match both capture groups 1 and 2.\nSee the full join input configuration in the pipeline specification.\nYou can test your glob pattern and capture groups by using the pachctl list datum -f \u0026lt;your_pipeline_spec.json\u0026gt; command as described in List Datum.\n💡 The content of the capture group defined in the join_on parameter is available to your pipeline\u0026rsquo;s code in an environment variable: PACH_DATUM_\u0026lt;input.name\u0026gt;_JOIN_ON.\nInner Join # Per default, a join input has an inner-join behavior.\nInner Join Example # For example, you have two repositories. One with sensor readings and the other with parameters. The repositories have the following structures:\nreadings repo:\n├── ID1234 ├── file1.txt ├── file2.txt ├── file3.txt ├── file4.txt ├── file5.txt parameters repo:\n├── file1.txt ├── file2.txt ├── file3.txt ├── file4.txt ├── file5.txt ├── file6.txt ├── file7.txt ├── file8.txt Pachyderm runs your code only on the pairs of files that match the glob pattern and capture groups.\nThe following example shows how you can use joins to group matching IDs:\n{ \u0026#34;pipeline\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;joins\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;join\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;readings\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;branch\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;master\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/*/(*).txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;join_on\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;parameters\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;branch\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;master\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/(*).txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;join_on\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; } } ] }, \u0026#34;transform\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;cmd\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;python3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/joins.py\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;joins-example\u0026#34; } } The glob pattern for the readings repository, /*/(*).txt, indicates all matching files in the ID sub-directory. In the parameters repository, the glob pattern /(*).txt selects all the matching files in the root directory. All files with indices from 1 to 5 match. The files with indices from 6 to 8 do not match. Therefore, you only get five datums for this job.\nTo experiment further, see the full joins example.\nOuter Join # Pachyderm also supports outer joins. Outer joins include everything an inner join does plus the files that didn\u0026rsquo;t match anything. Inputs can be set to outer semantics independently. So while there isn\u0026rsquo;t an explicit notion of \u0026ldquo;left\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; outer joins, you can still get those semantics, and even extend them to multiway joins.\nOuter Join Example # Building off the example above, notice that there are 3 files in the parameters repo, file6.txt, file7.txt and file8.txt, which don\u0026rsquo;t match any files in the readings repo. In an inner join, those files are omitted. If you still want to see the files without a match, you can use an outer join. The change to the pipeline spec is simple:\n{ \u0026#34;pipeline\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;joins\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;join\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;readings\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;branch\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;master\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/*/(*).txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;join_on\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;parameters\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;branch\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;master\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/(*).txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;join_on\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;outer_join\u0026#34;: true } } ] }, \u0026#34;transform\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;cmd\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;python3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/joins.py\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;joins-example\u0026#34; } } Your code will see the joined pairs that it saw before. In addition to those five datums, your code will also see three new ones: one for each of the files in parameters that didn\u0026rsquo;t match. Note that this means that your code needs to handle (not crash) the case where input files are missing from /pfs/readings.\nTo experiment further, see the full join example.\n",

Use the pachctl list datum \u0026lt;pipeline\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;job ID\u0026gt; to retrieve the list of datums processed by a given job, and pick the datum ID you want to inspect.

		"body": " ⚠️ Note that Pachyderm uses two different scopes when referring to a job.\nA \u0026ldquo;global\u0026rdquo; scope tracking down your entire provenance chain. Refer to GlobalID for more details. And a \u0026ldquo;local\u0026rdquo; scope in which a job (also referred to as sub job) is an execution of one particular pipeline. The following page details the latter.\nDefinition # A Pachyderm job is an execution of a pipeline that triggers when new data is detected in an input repository.\nℹ️ When a commit is made to the input repo of a pipeline, jobs are created for all of the downstream pipelines of a DAG. Those jobs are not running yet; each one is waiting until the prior pipeline(s) that it depends on in your DAG produces their output, which then becomes the input for the waiting pipeline.\nEach job runs your code against the current commit in a \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt; and then submits the results to the output repository of the pipeline as a single output commit. A pipeline triggers a new job every time you submit new changes, a commit, into your input source.\nEach job has an alphanumeric identifier (ID) that you can reference in the \u0026lt;pipeline\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;jobID\u0026gt; format.\nYou can obtain information about all jobs sharing the same ID (Global ID) by running list jobs \u0026lt;jobID\u0026gt; or restrict to a particular pipeline list jobs -p \u0026lt;pipeline\u0026gt;, or inspect jobs \u0026lt;pipeline\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;jobID\u0026gt; --raw.\nJob Statuses # Find a list of all possible job stages below and a state diagram detailing how a job transitions from one state to another.\nStage Description CREATED An input commit exists, but the job has not been started by a worker yet. STARTING The worker has allocated resources for the job (that is, the job counts towards parallelism), but it is still waiting on the inputs to be ready. UNRUNNABLE The job could not be run, because one or more of its inputs is the result of a failed or unrunnable job. As a simple example, say that pipelines Y and Z both depend on the output from pipeline X. If pipeline X fails, both pipeline Y and Z will pass from STARTING to UNRUNNABLE to signify that they had to be cancelled because of upstream failures. RUNNING The worker is processing datums. EGRESS The worker has completed all the datums and is uploading the output to the egress endpoint. FINISHING After all of the datum processing and egress (if any) is done, the job transitions to a finishing state where all of the post-processing tasks such as compaction are performed. FAILURE The worker encountered too many errors when processing a datum. KILLED The job timed out, or a user called StopJob SUCCESS None of the bad stuff happened. Below, the state transition diagram of a job:\nList Jobs # They are various ways to list jobs in Pachyderm, depending on the expected outcome:\nThe pachctl list jobs command returns the list of all global jobs.\nThe pachctl list jobs \u0026lt;jobID\u0026gt; command returns the list of all jobs sharing the same \u0026lt;jobID\u0026gt;.\nNote that you can also track your jobs downstream as they complete by running pachctl wait jobs \u0026lt;jobID\u0026gt;.\nThe pachctl list jobs -p \u0026lt;pipeline\u0026gt; command returns the list of all the jobs run in a given pipeline.\nExample # pachctl list jobs -p edges System Response:\nID PIPELINE STARTED DURATION RESTART PROGRESS DL UL STATE fd9454d06d8e4fa38a75c8cd20b39538 edges 20 hours ago 5 seconds 0 2 + 1 / 3 181.1KiB 111.4KiB success 5a78358d4b53494cbba4550428f2fe98 edges 20 hours ago 2 seconds 0 1 + 0 / 1 57.27KiB 22.22KiB success 7dcd77a2f7f34ff384a6096d1139e922 edges 20 hours ago Less than a second 0 0 + 0 / 0 0B 0B success For each (sub) job, Pachyderm shows the time the pipeline started, its duration, data downloaded and uploaded, the STATE of the pipeline execution, and the number of datums in the PROGRESS section.

		"body": "A pipeline is a Pachyderm primitive that is responsible for reading data from a specified source, such as a Pachyderm repo, transforming it according to the pipeline configuration, and writing the result to an output repo.\nA pipeline subscribes to a branch in one or more input repositories. Every time the branch has a new commit, the pipeline executes a job that runs your code to completion and writes the results to a commit in the output repository. Every pipeline automatically creates an output repository by the same name as the pipeline. For example, a pipeline named model writes all results to the model output repo.\nIn Pachyderm, a Pipeline is an individual execution step. You can chain multiple pipelines together to create a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\nYou define a pipeline declaratively, using a JSON or YAML file. Pipeline specification files follow Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s pipeline reference specification file.\nA minimum pipeline specification must include the following parameters:\nname — The name of your data pipeline. Set a meaningful name for your pipeline, such as the name of the transformation that the pipeline performs. For example, split or edges. Pachyderm automatically creates an output repository with the same name. A pipeline name must be an alphanumeric string that is less than 63 characters long and can include dashes and underscores. No other special characters allowed.\ninput — A location of the data that you want to process, such as a Pachyderm repository. You can specify multiple input repositories and set up the data to be combined in various ways. For more information, see Cross and Union, Join, Group. One very important property that is defined in the input field is the glob pattern that specifies how Pachyderm breaks the data into individual processing units, called Datums. For more information, see Datum.\ntransform — Specifies the code that you want to run against your data. The transform section must include an image field that defines the Docker image that you want to run, as well as a cmd field for the specific code within the container that you want to execute, such as a Python script.\nexample # { \u0026#34;pipeline\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;wordcount\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;transform\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;wordcount-image\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cmd\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;python3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/my_python_code.py\u0026#34;] }, \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34; } } } ",

Behavior # When you create a Cron pipeline, Pachyderm creates a new input data repository that corresponds to the cron input Then, Pachyderm automatically commits a timestamp file to the cron input repository at your determined interval, which triggers the pipeline.\nBy default, each cron trigger adds a new tick file to the cron input repository, accumulating more datums over time. Optionally, you can set the overwrite flag to true to overwrite the timestamp file on each tick.

		"body": "A spout is a type of pipeline that ingests streaming data from an outside source (message queue, database transactions logs, event notifications\u0026hellip; ) as schematized in the diagram below.\nGenerally, spout pipelines are ideal for situations when the frequency of new incoming data is sporadic, and the latency requirement to start the processing is short.\nIn these workloads, a regular pipeline with a cron input that polls for new data at a consistent time interval might not be an optimal solution.\nA spout pipeline differs from regular pipelines in many ways:\nits code runs continuously, waiting for new events. it does not take an input repo. Instead, it consumes data from an outside source. the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output repo, pfs/out is not directly accessible. To write into the output repo, you will need to use the put file API call via any of the following: the CLI (pachctl put file) one of the Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s SDKs (for golang or Python ) or your own API client. Pachyderm CLI (pachctl) is packaged in the base image of your spout as well as your authentication information. As a result, the authentication is seamless when using pachctl. ℹ️ Support for a transparent authentication in our SDKs is coming soon. In the meantime, check our Spout 101 example at the end of this page to learn how to retrieve and inject your authentication token into your API client.\nTo create a spout pipeline, you will need:\nA source of streaming data. A Docker container with your spout code that connects to, reads, transforms, and pushes data from the data source to your output repo. A spout pipeline specification file that uses your container. ℹ️ It is important to remember that you will need to use a put file API call from a client of your choice to push your data into the pipeline output repository. Having the entire Pachyderm API available to you allows you to package data into commits and transactions at the granularity your problem requires.\nA minimum spout specification must include the following parameters in the pipeline specification:\nParameter Description name The name of your data pipeline and the output repository. You can set an arbitrary name that is meaningful to the code you want to run. spout This attribute can be left empty. Optional: Add a service field to expose your spout as a service. transform Specifies the command that you want to call to ingest your data and the Docker image it is packaged in. xs Here is an example of a minimum spout pipeline specification:\nℹ️ The env property is an optional argument. You can define your data stream source from within the container in which you run your script. For simplicity, in this example, env specifies the source of the Kafka host.\n{ \u0026#34;pipeline\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-spout\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;spout\u0026#34;: { }, \u0026#34;transform\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;cmd\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;go\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;run\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./main.go\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myaccount/myimage:0.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;env\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;HOST\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;kafkahost\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;TOPIC\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;mytopic\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;PORT\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;9092\u0026#34; } } } Example # For a first overview of how spouts work, see our spout101 example.\n",

Because Pachyderm deals not only with plain text but also with binary files and large datasets, it does not process the data in the same way as Git. When you use Git, you store a copy of the repository on your local machine. You work with that copy, apply your changes, and then send the changes to the upstream master copy of the repository where it gets merged.\nPachyderm version control works slightly differently. In Pachyderm, only a centralized repository exists and you do not store any local copies of that repository. Therefore, the merge, in the traditional Git meaning, does not occur.\nInstead, your data can be continuously updated in the master branch of your repo, while you can experiment with specific data commits in a separate branch or branches. Because of this behavior, you cannot run into a merge conflict with Pachyderm.\n",

Most users prefer to create a master branch by initiating the first commit and specifying the master branch in the put file command.\nBranches enable collaboration between teams of data scientists. However, many users find it sufficient to use the master branch for all their work. Although the concept of a branch is similar to Git branches, in most cases, branches are not used as extensively as in source code version-control systems.\nA branch also stores information about provenance, the other branches it uses as input and which rely on its output. These branch relationships are how Pachyderm knows which data each pipeline relies on, and which branches and repos should be included in each commit.\nEach branch has a HEAD which references the latest commit in the branch. Pachyderm pipelines look at the HEAD of the branch for changes and, if they detect new changes, trigger a job. When you commit a new change, the HEAD of the branch moves to the latest commit.\nYou can create additional branches to experiment with the data (pachctl create branch \u0026lt;myrepo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;branchname\u0026gt;.

		"body": " ℹ️ Note that Pachyderm uses the term commit at two different levels. A global level (check GlobalID for more details) and commits that occur on the given branch of a repository. The following page details the latter.\nDefinition # In Pachyderm, commits are atomic operations that snapshot and preserve the state of the files and directories in a repository at a point in time. Unlike Git commits, Pachyderm commits are centralized and transactional. You can start a commit by running the pachctl start commit command with reference to a specific repository. After you\u0026rsquo;re done making changes to the repository (put file, delete file, \u0026hellip;), you can finish your modifications by running the pachctl finish commit command. This command saves your changes and closes that repository\u0026rsquo;s commit, indicating the data is ready for processing by downstream pipelines.\n⚠️ start commit can only be used on input repos without provenance. Such repos are the entry points of a DAG. You cannot manually start a commit from a pipeline output or meta repo.\nWhen you create a new commit, the previous commit on which the new commit is based becomes the parent of the new commit. Your repo history consists of those parent-child relationships between your data commits.\nℹ️ An initial commit has \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; as a parent.\nAdditionally, commits have an \u0026ldquo;origin\u0026rdquo;. You can see an origin as the answer to: \u0026ldquo;What triggered the production of this commit?\u0026rdquo;.\nThat origin can be of 3 types:\nUSER: The commit is the result of a user change (put file, update pipeline, delete file\u0026hellip;) 📖 Every USER change is an initial commit.\nAUTO: Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s pipelines are data-driven. A data commit to a data repository may trigger downstream processing jobs in your pipeline(s). The output commits from triggered jobs will be of type AUTO. ALIAS: Neither USER nor AUTO - ALIAS commits are essentially placeholder commits. They have the same content as their parent commit and are mainly used for global IDs. ℹ️ To track provenance, Pachyderm requires all commits to belong to exactly one branch. When moving a commit from one branch to another, Pachyderm creates an ALIAS commit on the other branch.\nEach commit has an alphanumeric identifier (ID) that you can reference in the \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;commitID\u0026gt; format (or \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;commitID\u0026gt; if the commit has multiple branches from the same repo) .\nYou can obtain information about all commits with a given ID by running pachctl list commit \u0026lt;commitID\u0026gt; or restrict to a particular repository pachctl list commit \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;, pachctl list commit \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;, or pachctl inspect commit \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;commitID\u0026gt; --raw.\nList Commits # The pachctl list commit command returns list of all global commits.

		"body": "Pachyderm implements rich version-control and history semantics. This section describes the core concepts and architecture of Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s version control and the various ways to use the system to access historical data.\nThe following abstractions store the history of your data:\nCommits\nIn Pachyderm, commits are the core version-control primitive that is similar to Git commits. Commits represent an immutable snapshot of a filesystem and can be accessed with an ID. They have a parentage structure, where new commits inherit content from their parents. You can think of this parentage structure as of a linked list or a chain of commits.\nBranches\nBranches are pointers to commits that are similar to Git branches. Typically, branches have semantically meaningful names such as master and staging. Branches are mutable, and they move along a growing chain of commits as you commit to the branch, and can even be reassigned to any commit within the repo by using the pachctl create branch command. The commit that a branch points to is referred to as the branches head, and the head\u0026rsquo;s ancestors are referred to as on the branch. Branches can be substituted for commits in Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s API and behave as if the head of the branch were passed.\nAncestry Syntax # Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s commits and branches support a familiar Git syntax for referencing their history. A commit or branch parent can be referenced by adding a ^ to the end of the commit or branch. Similar to how master resolves to the head of master, master^ resolves to the parent of the head. You can add multiple ^s. For example, master^^ resolves to the parent of the parent of the head master, and so on. Similarly, master^3 has the same meaning as master^^^.\nGit supports two characters for ancestor references —^ and ~— with slightly different meanings. Pachyderm supports both characters as well, but their meaning is identical.\nAlso, Pachyderm supports a type of ancestor reference that Git does not: the forward reference, using the special character .. It resolves to commits on the beginning of commit chains. For example, master.1 is the first (oldest) commit on the master branch, master.2 is the second commit, and so on.\nℹ️ Resolving ancestry syntax requires traversing chains of commits high numbers passed to ^ and low numbers passed to .. These operations might take a long time. If you plan to repeatedly access an ancestor, you might want to resolve that ancestor with pachctl inspect commit \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;branch or commitID\u0026gt;.\nView the Pipeline History # Pipelines are the main processing primitive in Pachyderm. However, they expose version-control and history semantics similar to filesystem objects. This is largely because, under the hood, they are implemented in terms of filesystem objects. You can access previous versions of a pipeline by using the same ancestry syntax that works for commits and branches. For example, pachctl inspect pipeline foo^ gives you the previous version of the pipeline foo. The pachctl inspect pipeline foo.1 command returns the first ever version of that same pipeline. You can use this syntax in all operations and scripts that accept pipeline names.\nTo view historical versions of a pipeline use the --history flag with the pachctl list pipeline command:\npachctl list pipeline --history all System Response:\nNAME VERSION INPUT CREATED STATE / LAST JOB Pipeline2 1 input2:/* 4 hours ago running / success Pipeline1 3 input1:/* 4 hours ago running / success Pipeline1 2 input1:/* 4 hours ago running / success Pipeline1 1 input1:/* 4 hours ago running / success View the Job History # Jobs do not have versioning semantics associated with them. However, they are strongly associated with the pipelines that created them. Therefore, they inherit some of their versioning semantics. You can use the -p \u0026lt;pipeline\u0026gt; flag with the pachctl list job command to list all the jobs that were run for the latest version of the pipeline.\nFurthermore, you can get jobs from multiple versions of a pipeline by passing the --history flag. For example, pachctl list job -p edges --history all returns all jobs from all versions of the pipeline edges.\n",

		"body": "Data versioning (History) enables Pachyderm users to go back in time and see the state of a dataset or repository at a particular moment.\nData provenance (from the French noun provenance which means the place of origin), also known as data lineage, tracks the dependencies and relationships between datasets. It answers the question \u0026ldquo;Where does the data come from?\u0026rdquo;, but also \u0026ldquo;How was the data transformed along the way?\u0026rdquo;.\nPachyderm enables its users to have both: track all revisions of their data and understand the connection between the data stored in one repository and the results in the other repository.\nIt automatically maintains a complete audit trail, allowing all results to be fully reproducible.\nThe following diagram is an illustration of how provenance works:\nIn the diagram above, two input repositories (model and test_data) feed a scoring pipeline. The model repository continuously collects model artifacts from an outside source. The pipeline combines the data from these two repositories and scores each model against the validation dataset.\nGlobal ID is an easy tool to help you track down your entire provenance chain and understand what data and transformation processes were involved in a specific version of a dataset. Here, the ID1 is shared by all commits and jobs involved in creating the final scoring v1. A simple pachctl list commit ID1 (pachctl list job ID1) will return that list at once.\nTracking Direct Provenance in Pachyderm # Pachyderm provides the pachctl inspect command that enables you to track the direct provenance of your commits and learn where the data in the repository originates in.\nExample # pachctl inspect commit edges@71c791f3252c492a8f8ad9a51e5a5cd5 --raw System Response:\n{ \u0026#34;commit\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;branch\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;edges\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;master\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;71c791f3252c492a8f8ad9a51e5a5cd5\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;origin\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;kind\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AUTO\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;parent_commit\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;branch\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;edges\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;master\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;b6fc0ab2d8d04972b0c31b0e35133323\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;started\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-07-07T19:53:17.242981574Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;finished\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-07-07T19:53:19.598729672Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;direct_provenance\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;edges\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;spec\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;master\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;images\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;master\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;details\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;size_bytes\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;22754\u0026#34; } } Provenance information: In the example above, you can see that the commit 71c791f3252c492a8f8ad9a51e5a5cd5 on the master branch of the edges repo was automatically produced (origin.kind = AUTO) from a user input on the master branch of the images repo processed by the edges pipeline (direct_provenance).\nHistory: Additionally, the parent of the commit 71c791f3252c492a8f8ad9a51e5a5cd5 in the edges repo has the id b6fc0ab2d8d04972b0c31b0e35133323.\nTraversing Provenance and Subvenance # In Pachyderm, all the related steps in a DAG share the same identifier, making it easy to traverse the provenance and subvenance in any commit.\nAll it takes is to run pachctl list commit \u0026lt;commitID\u0026gt; to get the full list of all the branches with commits created along the way due to provenance relationships.\nVisit the Global ID Page for more details.\n",

		"body": " Definition # A Pachyderm repository is a location where you store your data inside Pachyderm. It is a top-level data object that contains files and folders.\nSimilar to Git, a Pachyderm repository tracks all changes to the data and creates a history of data modifications that you can access and review.\n📖 You can store any type of file in a Pachyderm repo, including binary and plain text files.\nUnlike a Git repository that stores history in a .git file in your copy of a Git repo, Pachyderm stores the history of your commits in a centralized location. Because of that, you do not run into merge conflicts as you often do with Git commits when you try to merge your .git history with the master copy of the repo. With large datatsets resolving a merge conflict might not be possible.\nA Pachyderm repository is the first entity that you configure when you want to add data to Pachyderm. You can create a repository with the pachctl create repo command, or by using one of Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s client API. After creating the repository, add your data by using the pachctl put file command.\n⚠️ A Pachyderm repo name can include alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores, and should be no more than 63 characters long.\nPachyderm\u0026rsquo;s repositories are divided into two categories:\nUser repositories\nUser repositories keep track of your data one commit at a time. They further split into:\nSource repositories\nUsers or external applications outside of Pachyderm can add data to the source repositories for further processing.\nOutput repositories\nPachyderm automatically creates an output repository at the end of a pipeline for the pipeline to write the results of its transformations into. An output repository might serve as input for another pipeline.\nSystem repositories\nSystem repositories hold certain auxiliary information about pipelines. They are hidden by default in the output of most commands. Along with an output repo, the creation of a pipeline also creates one spec and one meta repo.\nspec repositories hold pipeline specification files meta repositories hold metadata related to datum processing (also called \u0026ldquo;stats\u0026rdquo; in this documentation) Pipelines generally manage their own system repos, but if necessary, the system repos for a pipeline named edges can be referenced using edges.meta and edges.spec wherever you would usually put a repo name. Deleting a user repo deletes any associated system repos.\nList Your Repos # You can view the list of all user repositories in your Pachyderm cluster by running the pachctl list repo command.\nExample # pachctl list repo System Response:\nNAME CREATED SIZE (MASTER) ACCESS LEVEL montage 19 hours ago 1.664MiB [repoOwner] Output repo for pipeline montage. edges 19 hours ago 133.6KiB [repoOwner] Output repo for pipeline edges. images 19 hours ago 238.3KiB [repoOwner] Additionally, pachctl list repo --all will let you see all repos of all types, and pachctl list repo --type=spec or pachctl list repo --type=meta will filter the spec or meta repos only.\nInspect a Repo # The pachctl inspect repo command provides a more detailed overview of a specified repository.\nExample # pachctl inspect repo raw_data System Response:\nName: raw_data Description: A raw data repository Created: 6 hours ago Size of HEAD on master: 5.121MiB Add a --raw flag to output a more detailed JSON version of the repo\u0026rsquo;s metadata.\nDelete a Repo # If you need to delete a repository, you can run the pachctl delete repo command. This command deletes all data and the information about the specified repository, such as commit history. The delete operation is irreversible and results in a complete cleanup of your Pachyderm cluster. If you run the delete command with the --all flag, all repositories will be deleted.\n💡 See Also: Pipeline\n",

		"body": " 📖 Before you read this section, make sure that you understand the concepts described in the following sections:\nDatum Distributed Computing Developer Workflow If you are analyzing data that is changing over time, you might need to analyze historical data. For example, you might need to examine the last two weeks of data, January\u0026rsquo;s data, or some other moving or static time window of data.\nPachyderm provides the following approaches to this task:\nFixed time windows - for rigid, fixed time windows, such as months (Jan, Feb, and so on) or days—01-01-17, 01-02-17, and so on).\nMoving time windows\nfor rolling time windows of data, such as three-day windows or two-week windows. Fixed Time Windows # Datum is the basic unit of data partitioning in Pachyderm. The glob pattern property in the pipeline specification defines a datum. When you analyze data within fixed time windows, such as the data that corresponds to fixed calendar dates, Pachyderm recommends that you organize your data repositories so that each of the time windows that you plan to analyze corresponds to a separate file or directory in your repository, and therefore, Pachyderm processes it as a separate datum.\nOrganizing your repository as described above, enables you to do the following:\nAnalyze each time window in parallel. Only re-process data within a time window when that data, or a corresponding data pipeline, changes. For example, if you have monthly time windows of sales data stored in JSON format that needs to be analyzed, you can create a sales data repository with the following data:\nsales ├── January | ├── 01-01-17.json | ├── 01-02-17.json | └── ... ├── February | ├── 01-01-17.json | ├── 01-02-17.json | └── ... └── March ├── 01-01-17.json ├── 01-02-17.json └── ... When you run a pipeline with sales as an input repository and a glob pattern of /*, Pachyderm processes each month\u0026rsquo;s worth of sales data in parallel if workers are available. When you add new data into a subset of the months or add data into a new month, for example, May, Pachyderm processes only these updated datums.\nMore generally, this structure enables you to create the following types of pipelines:\nPipelines that aggregate or otherwise process daily data on a monthly basis by using the /* glob pattern. Pipelines that only analyze a particular month\u0026rsquo;s data by using a /subdir/* or /subdir/ glob pattern. For example, /January/* or /January/. Pipelines that process data on daily by using the /*/* glob pattern. Any combination of the above. Moving Time Windows # In some cases, you need to run analyses for moving or rolling time windows that do not correspond to certain calendar months or days. For example, you might need to analyze the last three days of data, the three days of data before that, or similar. In other words, you need to run an analysis for every rolling length of time.\nFor rolling or moving time windows, there are a couple of recommended patterns:\nBin your data in repository folders for each of the moving time windows.\nMaintain a time-windowed set of data that corresponds to the latest of the moving time windows.\nBin Data into Moving Time Windows # In this method of processing rolling time windows, you create the following two-pipeline DAGs to analyze time windows efficiently:\nPipeline Description Pipeline 1 Reads in data, determines to which bins the data corresponds, and writes the data into those bins. Pipeline 2 Read in and analyze the binned data. By splitting this analysis into two pipelines, you can benefit from using parallelism at the file level. In other words, Pipeline 1 can be easily parallelized for each file, and Pipeline 2 can be parallelized per bin. This structure enables easy pipeline scaling as the number of files increases.\nFor example, you have three-day moving time windows, and you want to analyze three-day moving windows of sales data. In the first repo, called sales, you commit data for the first day of sales:\nsales └── 01-01-17.json In the first pipeline, you specify to bin this data into a directory that corresponds to the first rolling time window from 01-01-17 to 01-03-17:\nbinned_sales └── 01-01-17_to_01-03-17 └── 01-01-17.json When the next day\u0026rsquo;s worth of sales is committed, that data lands in the sales repository:\nsales ├── 01-01-17.json └── 01-02-17.json Then, the first pipeline executes again to bin the 01-02-17 data into relevant bins. In this case, the data is placed in the previously created bin named 01-01-17 to 01-03-17. However, the data also goes to the bin that stores the data that is received starting on 01-02-17:\nbinned_sales ├── 01-01-17_to_01-03-17 | ├── 01-01-17.json | └── 01-02-17.json └── 01-02-17_to_01-04-17 └── 01-02-17.json As more and more daily data is added, your repository structure starting to looks as follows:\nbinned_sales ├── 01-01-17_to_01-03-17 | ├── 01-01-17.json | ├── 01-02-17.json | └── 01-03-17.json ├── 01-02-17_to_01-04-17 | ├── 01-02-17.json | ├── 01-03-17.json | └── 01-04-17.json ├── 01-03-17_to_01-05-17 | ├── 01-03-17.json | ├── 01-04-17.json | └── 01-05-17.json └── ... The following diagram describes how data accumulates in the repository over time:\nYour second pipeline can then process these bins in parallel according to the glob pattern of /* or as described further. Both pipelines can be easily parallelized.\nIn the above directory structure, it might seem that data is duplicated. However, under the hood, Pachyderm deduplicates all of these files and maintains a space-efficient representation of your data. The binning of the data is merely a structural re-arrangement to enable you to process these types of moving time windows.\nIt might also seem as if Pachyderm performs unnecessary data transfers over the network to bin files. However, Pachyderm ensures that these data operations do not require transferring data over the network.\nMaintaining a Single Time-Windowed Data Set # The advantage of the binning pattern above is that any of the moving time windows are available for processing. They can be compared, aggregated, and combined in any way, and any results or aggregations are kept in sync with updates to the bins. However, you do need to create a process to maintain the binning directory structure.\nThere is another pattern for moving time windows that avoids the binning of the above approach and maintains an up-to-date version of a moving time-windowed data set. This approach involves the creation of the following pipelines:\nPipeline Description Pipeline 1 Reads in data, determines which files belong in your moving time window, and writes the relevant files into an updated\nversion of the moving time-windowed data set. Pipeline 2 Reads in and analyzes the moving time-windowed data set. For example, you have three-day moving time windows, and you want to analyze three-day moving windows of sales data. The input data is stored in the sales repository:\nsales ├── 01-01-17.json ├── 01-02-17.json ├── 01-03-17.json └── 01-04-17.json When the January 4th file, 01-04-17.json, is committed, the first pipeline pulls out the last three days of data and arranges it in the following order:\nlast_three_days ├── 01-02-17.json ├── 01-03-17.json └── 01-04-17.json When the January 5th file, 01-05-17.json, is committed into the sales repository:\nsales ├── 01-01-17.json ├── 01-02-17.json ├── 01-03-17.json ├── 01-04-17.json └── 01-05-17.json the first pipeline updates the moving window:\nlast_three_days ├── 01-03-17.json ├── 01-04-17.json └── 01-05-17.json The analysis that you need to run on the moving windowed dataset in moving_sales_window can use the / or /* glob pattern, depending on whether you need to process all of the time-windowed files together or if they can be processed in parallel.\n⚠️ When you create this type of moving time-windowed data set, the concept of now or today is relative. You must define the time based on your use case. For example, by configuring to use UTC. Do not use functions such as time.now() to determine the current time. The actual time when this pipeline runs might vary.\n",

You can mount that folder as a volume in Kubernetes and make it available in your pipeline worker by using the pod_patch pipeline parameter. The pod_patch parameter takes a string that specifies the changes that you want to add to your existing manifest. To create a patch, you need to generate a diff of the original ReplicationController and the one with your changes. You can use one of the online JSON patch utilities, such as JSON Patch Generator to create a diff. A diff for mounting a volume might look like this:\n[ { \u0026#34;op\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;add\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/volumes/-\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;task-pv-storage\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;persistentVolumeClaim\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;claimName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;task-pv-claim\u0026#34; } } }, { \u0026#34;op\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;add\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/containers/0/volumeMounts/-\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;mountPath\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;task-pv-volume\u0026#34; } } ] This output needs to be converted into a one-liner and added to the pipeline spec.\nWe will use the OpenCV example. to demonstrate this functionality.\nTo mount a volume, complete the following steps:\nCreate a PersistentVolume and a PersistentVolumeClaim as described in Configure a Pod to Use a PersistentVolume for Storage. Modify mountPath and path as needed.\nFor testing purposes, you might want to add an index.html file as described in Create an index.html file.\nGet the ReplicationController (RC) manifest from your pipeline:\nkubectl get rc \u0026lt;rc-pipeline\u0026gt; -o json \u0026gt; \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt;.yaml Example:\nkubectl get rc pipeline-edges-v7 -o json \u0026gt; test-rc.yaml Open the generated RC manifest for editing.\nUnder spec, find the volumeMounts section.\nAdd your volume in the list of mounts.\nExample:\n{ \u0026#34;mountPath\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;task-pv-storage\u0026#34; } mountPath is where your volume will be mounted inside of the container.\nFind the volumes section.\nAdd the information about the volume.\nExample:\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;task-pv-storage\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;persistentVolumeClaim\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;claimName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;task-pv-claim\u0026#34; } } In this section, you need to specify the PersistentVolumeClaim you have created in Step 1.\nSave these changes to a new file.\nCopy the contents of the original RC to the clipboard.\nGo to a JSON patch generator, such as JSON Patch Generator, and paste the contents of the original RC manifest to the Source JSON field.\nCopy the contents of the modified RC manifest to clipboard as described above.\nPaste the contents of the modified RC manifest to the Target JSON field.\nCopy the generated JSON Patch.\nGo to your terminal and open the pipeline manifest for editing.\nFor example, if you are modifying the edges pipeline, open the edges.json file.\nAdd the patch as a one-liner under the pod_patch parameter.\nExample:\n\u0026#34;pod_patch\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;[{\\\u0026#34;op\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;add\\\u0026#34;,\\\u0026#34;path\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;/volumes/-\\\u0026#34;,\\\u0026#34;value\\\u0026#34;: {\\\u0026#34;name\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;task-pv-storage\\\u0026#34;,\\\u0026#34;persistentVolumeClaim\\\u0026#34;: {\\\u0026#34;claimName\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;task-pv-claim\\\u0026#34;}}}, {\\\u0026#34;op\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;add\\\u0026#34;,\\\u0026#34;path\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;/containers/0/volumeMounts/-\\\u0026#34;,\\\u0026#34;value\\\u0026#34;: {\\\u0026#34;mountPath\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;/data\\\u0026#34;,\\\u0026#34;name\\\u0026#34;: \\\u0026#34;task-pv-storage\\\u0026#34;}}]\u0026#34; You need to add a backslash () before every quote (\u0026quot;) sign that is enclosed in square brackets ([]). Also, you might need to modify the path to volumeMounts and volumes by removing the /spec/template/spec/ prefix and replacing the assigned volume number with a dash (-). For example, if a path in the JSON patch is /spec/template/spec/volumes/5, you might need to replace it with /volumes/-. See the example above for details.\nAfter modifying the pipeline spec, update the pipeline:\npachctl update pipeline -f \u0026lt;pipeline-spec.yaml\u0026gt; A new pod and new replication controller should be created with your modified changes.\nVerify that your file was mounted by connecting to your pod and listing the directory that you have specified as a mountpoint. In this example, it is /data.\nExample:\nkubectl exec -it \u0026lt;pipeline-pod\u0026gt; -- /bin/bash ls /data If you have added the index.html file for testing as described in Step 1, you should see that file in the mounted directory.\nYou might want to adjust your pipeline code to read from or write to the mounted directory. For example, in the aforementioned OpenCV example, the code reads from the /pfs/images directory and writes to the /pfs/out directory. If you want to read or write to the /data directory, you need to change those to /data.\n📖 Pachyderm has no notion of the files stored in the mounted directory before it is mounted to Pachyderm. Moreover, if you have mounted a network share to which you write files from other than Pachyderm sources, Pachyderm does not guarantee the provenance of those changes.\n",

		"body": " ℹ️ The err_cmd parameter enables you to fail a datum without failing the whole job.\n💡 Before you read this section, make sure that you understand such concepts as Datum and Pipeline.\nWhen Pachyderm processes your data, it breaks it up into units of computation called datums. Each datum is processed separately. In a basic pipeline configuration, a failed datum results in a failed job. However, in some cases, you might not need all datums to consider a job successful. If your downstream pipelines can be run on only the successful datums instead of needing all the datums to be successful, Pachyderm can mark some datums as recovered which means that they failed with a non-critical error, but the successful datums will be processed.\nTo configure a condition under which you want your failed datums not to fail the whole job, you can add your custom error code in err_cmd and err_stdin fields in your pipeline specification.\nFor example, your DAG consists of two pipelines:\nThe pipeline 1 cleans the data. The pipeline 2 trains your model by using the data from the first pipeline. That means that the second pipeline takes the results of the first pipeline from its output repository and uses that data to train a model. In some cases, you might not need all the datums in the first pipeline to be successful to run the second pipeline.\nThe following diagram describes how Pachyderm transformation and error code work:\nHere is what is happening in the diagram above:\nPachyderm executes the transformation code that you defined in the cmd field against your datums. If a datum is processed without errors, Pachyderm marks it as processed. If a datum fails, Pachyderm executes your error code (err_cmd) on that datum. If the code in err_cmd successfully runs on the skipped datum, Pachyderm marks the skipped datum as recovered. The datum is in a failed state and, therefore, the pipeline does not put it into the output repository, but successful datums continue onto the next step in your DAG. If the err_cmd code fails on the skipped datum, the datum is marked as failed, and, consequently, the job is marked as failed. You can view the processed, skipped, and recovered datums in the PROGRESS field in the output of the pachctl list job -p \u0026lt;pipeline name\u0026gt; command:\nPachyderm writes only processed datums of successful jobs to the output commit so that these datums can be processed by downstream pipelines. For example, in your first pipeline, Pachyderm processes three datums. If one of the datums is marked as recovered and two others are successfully processed, only these two successful datums are used in the next pipeline.\nIf you want to let the job proceed with only the successful datums being written to the output, set \u0026quot;err_cmd\u0026quot; : [\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;]. The failed datums, which are \u0026ldquo;recovered\u0026rdquo; by err_cmd in this way, will be retried on the next job, just as failed datums.\nℹ️ See Also: Example err_cmd pipeline\n",

		"body": " ℹ️ TL;DR:Use transactions to run multiple Pachyderm commands simultaneously in one job run.\nA transaction is a Pachyderm operation that enables you to create a collection of Pachyderm commands and execute them concurrently. Regular Pachyderm operations, that are not in a transaction, are executed one after another. However, when you need to run multiple commands at the same time, you can use transactions. This functionality is useful in particular for pipelines with multiple inputs. If you need to update two or more input repos, you might not want pipeline jobs for each state change. You can issue a transaction to start commits in each of the input repos, which puts them both in the same global commit, creating a single downstream commit in the pipeline repo. After the transaction, you can put files and finish the commits at will, and the pipeline job will run once all the input commits have been finished.\nStart and Finish Transaction Demarcations # A transaction demarcation initializes some transactional behavior before the demarcated area begins, then ends that transactional behavior when the demarcated area ends. You should see those demarcations as a declaration of the group of commands that will be treated together as a single coherent operation.\nTo start a transaction demarcation, run the following command:\npachctl start transaction System Response:\nStarted new transaction: 7a81eab5e6c6430aa5c01deb06852ca5 This command generates a transaction object in the cluster and saves its ID in the local Pachyderm configuration file. By default, this file is stored at ~/.pachyderm/config.json.\nExample # { \u0026#34;user_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;b4fe4317-be21-4836-824f-6661c68b8fba\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;v2\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;active_context\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;local-2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;contexts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;local-2\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: 3, \u0026#34;active_transaction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;7a81eab5e6c6430aa5c01deb06852ca5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cluster_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;minikube\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;auth_info\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;minikube\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;namespace\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; }, After you start a transaction demarcation, you can add supported commands (i.e., transactional commands), such as pachctl start commit, pachctl create branch \u0026hellip;, to the transaction.\nAll commands that are performed in a transaction are queued up and not executed against the actual cluster until you finish the transaction. When you finish the transaction, all queued command are executed atomically.\nTo finish a transaction, run:\npachctl finish transaction System Response:\nCompleted transaction with 1 requests: 7a81eab5e6c6430aa5c01deb06852ca5 💡 As soon as a commit is started (whether through start commit or put file without an open commit, or finishing a transaction that contains a start commit), a new global commit as well as a global job is created. All open commits are in a started state, each of the pipeline jobs created is running, and the workers waiting for the commit(s) to be closed to process the data. In other words, your changes will only be applied when you close the commits.\nIn the case of a transaction, the workers will wait until all of the input commits are finished to process them in one batch. All of those commits and jobs will be part of the same global commit/job and share the same globalID (Transaction ID). Without a transaction, each commit would trigger its own separate job.\nWe have used the inner join pipeline in our joins example to illustrate the difference between no transaction and the use a transaction, all other things being equal. Make sure to follow the example README if you want to run those pachctl commands yourself.\nℹ️ Note that in the case with the transaction, the put file and following finish commit are happening after the finish transaction instruction.\nYou must finish your transaction before putting files in the corresponding repo for the data to be part of the same batch. Running a \u0026lsquo;put file\u0026rsquo; before closing the transaction would result in a commit being created independently from the transaction itself and a job to run on that commit.\nSupported Operations # While there is a transaction object in the Pachyderm configuration file, all supported API requests append the request to the transaction instead of running directly. These supported commands include:\ncreate repo delete repo update repo start commit finish commit squash commit create branch delete branch create pipeline update pipeline edit pipeline Each time you add a command to a transaction, Pachyderm validates the transaction against the current state of the cluster metadata and obtains any return values, which is important for such commands as start commit. If validation fails for any reason, Pachyderm does not add the operation to the transaction. If the transaction has been invalidated by changing the cluster state, you must delete the transaction and start over, taking into account the new state of the cluster. From a command-line perspective, these commands work identically within a transaction as without. The only differences are that you do not apply your changes until you run finish transaction, and Pachyderm logs a message to stderr to indicate that the command was placed in a transaction rather than run directly.\nOther Transaction Commands # Other supported commands for transactions include:\nCommand Description pachctl list transaction List all unfinished transactions available in the Pachyderm cluster. pachctl stop transaction Remove the currently active transaction from the local Pachyderm config file. The transaction remains in the Pachyderm cluster and can be resumed later. pachctl resume transaction Set an already-existing transaction as the active transaction in the local Pachyderm config file. pachctl delete transaction Deletes a transaction from the Pachyderm cluster. pachctl inspect transaction Provides detailed information about an existing transaction, including which operations it will perform. By default, displays information about the current transaction. If you specify a transaction ID, displays information about the corresponding transaction. Multiple Opened Transactions # Some systems have a notion of nested transactions. That is when you open transactions within an already opened transaction. In such systems, the operations added to the subsequent transactions are not executed until all the nested transactions and the main transaction are finished.\nPachyderm does not support such behavior. Instead, when you open a transaction, the transaction ID is written to the Pachyderm configuration file. If you begin another transaction while the first one is open, Pachyderm returns an error.\nEvery time you add a command to a transaction, Pachyderm creates a blueprint of the commit and verifies that the command is valid. However, one transaction can invalidate another. In this case, a transaction that is closed first takes precedence over the other. For example, if two transactions create a repository with the same name, the one that is executed first results in the creation of the repository, and the other results in error.\nUse Cases # Pachyderm users implement transactions to their own workflows finding unique ways to benefit from this feature, whether it is a small research team or an enterprise-grade machine learning workflow.\nBelow are examples of the most commonly employed ways of using transactions.\nCommit to Separate Repositories Simultaneously # For example, you have a Pachyderm pipeline with two input repositories. One repository includes training data and the other parameters for your machine learning pipeline. If you need to run specific data against specific parameters, you need to run your pipeline against specific commits in both repositories. To achieve this, you need to commit to these repositories simultaneously.\nIf you use a regular Pachyderm workflow, the data is uploaded sequentially, each time triggering a separate job instead of one job with both commits of new data. One put file operation commits changes to the data repository and the other updates the parameters repository. The following animation shows the standard Pachyderm workflow without a transaction:\nIn Pachyderm, a pipeline starts as soon as a new commit lands in a repository. In the diagram above, as soon as commit 1 is added to the data repository, Pachyderm runs a job for commit 1 and commit 0 in the parameters repository. You can also see that Pachyderm runs the second job and processes commit 1 from the data repository with the commit 1 in the parameters repository. In some cases, this is perfectly acceptable solution. But if your job takes many hours and you are only interested in the result of the pipeline run with commit 1 from both repositories, this approach does not work.\nWith transactions, you can ensure that only one job triggers with both the new data and parameters. The following animation demonstrates how transactions work:\nThe transaction ensures that a single job runs for the two commits that were started within the transaction. While Pachyderm supports some workflows where you can get the same effect by having both data and parameters in the same repo, often separating them and using transactions is much more efficient for organizational and performance reasons.\nSwitching from Staging to Master Simultaneously # If you are using deferred processing in your repositories because you want to commit your changes frequently without triggering jobs every time, then transactions can help you manage deferred processing with multiple inputs. You commit your changes to the staging branch and when needed, switch the HEAD of your master branch to a commit in the staging branch. To do this simultaneously, you can use transactions.\nFor example, you have two repositories data and parameters, both of which have a master and staging branch. You commit your changes to the staging branch while your pipeline is subscribed to the master branch. To switch to these branches simultaneously, you can use transactions like this:\npachctl start transaction System Response:\nStarted new transaction: 0d6f0bc337a0493696e382034a2a2055 pachctl pachctl create branch data@master --head staging Added to transaction: 0d6f0bc337a0493696e382034a2a2055 pachctl create branch parameters@master --head staging Added to transaction: 0d6f0bc337a0493696e382034a2a2055 pachctl finish transaction Completed transaction with 2 requests: 0d6f0bc337a0493696e382034a2a2055 When you finish the transaction, both repositories switch to the master branch at the same time which triggers one job to process those commits together.\nUpdating Multiple Pipelines Simultaneously # If you want to change logic or intermediate data formats in your DAG, you may need to change multiple pipelines. Performing these changes together in a transaction can avoid creating jobs with mismatched pipeline versions and potentially wasting work.\nTo get a better understanding of how transactions work in practice, try Use Transactions with Hyperparameter Tuning.\n",

		"body": " ⚠️ SQL Egress is an experimental feature.\nPachyderm already implements egress to object storage as an optional egress field in the pipeline specification. Similarly, our SQL egress lets you seamlessly export data from a Pachyderm-powered pipeline output repo to an SQL database.\nSpecifically, we help you connect to a remote database and push the content of CSV files to interface tables, matching their column names and casting their content into their respective SQL datatype.\nInterface tables are intermediate tables used for staging the data being egressed from Pachyderm to your data warehouse. They are the tables your SQL Egress pipeline inserts its data into and should be dedicated tables. The content of your interface tables matches the content of the latest output commit of your pipeline.\nℹ️ Best Practice.\nA new output commit will trigger a delete of all data in the interface tables before inserting more recent values. As a best practice, we strongly recommend to create a separate database for Pachyderm Egress.\nAs of today, we support the following drivers:\npostgres and postgresql : connect to Postgresql (or compatible databases such as Redshift). mysql : connect to MySQL (or compatible databases such as MariaDB). snowflake : connect to Snowflake. Use SQL Egress # To egress data from the output commit of a pipeline to an SQL database, you will need to:\nOn your cluster\nCreate a secret containing your database password.\nIn the Specification file of your egress pipeline\nReference your secret by providing its name, provide the connection string to the database and choose the format of the files (CSV for now - we are planning on adding JSON soon) containing the data to insert.\nIn your user code\nWrite your data into CSV files placed in root directories named after the table you want to insert them into. You can have multiple directories.\n1. Create a Secret # Create a secret containing your database password in the field PACHYDERM_SQL_PASSWORD. This secret is identical to the database secret of Pachyderm SQL Ingest. Refer to the SQL Ingest page for instructions on how to create your secret.\n2. Update your Pipeline Spec # Append an egress section to your pipeline specification file, then fill in:\nthe url: the connection string to your database. Its format is identical to the url in the SQL Ingest.\nthe file_format type: CSV for now.\nthe name: the Kubernetes secret name.\nthe columns: Optional array for egress of CSV files with headers only. The order of the columns in this array must match the order of the schema columns; however, the CSV columns can be any order. So if the array is [\u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;] and the CSV file is:\nbar,foo 1,\u0026#34;string\u0026#34; 2,\u0026#34;text!\u0026#34; The following table will be written to the database:\nfoo | bar =============== string | 1 text! | 2 Example # { \u0026#34;pipeline\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;egress\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input_repo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;in\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;transform\u0026#34;: { ... }, \u0026#34;egress\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;sql_database\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;snowflake://pachyderm@WHMUWUD-CJ80657/PACH_DB/PUBLIC?warehouse=COMPUTE_WH\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;file_format\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CSV\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;columns\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;] }, \u0026#34;secret\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;snowflakesecret\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PACHYDERM_SQL_PASSWORD\u0026#34; } } } } 3. In your User Code, Write Your Data to Directories Named After Each Table # The user code of your pipeline determines what data should be egressed and to which tables. Data (in the form of CSV files) that the pipeline writes to the output repo is interpreted as tables corresponding to directories.\nEach top-level directory is named after the table you want to egress its content to. All of the files reachable in the walk of each root directory are parsed in the given format indicated in the egress section of the pipeline specification file (CSV for now), then inserted in their corresponding table. Find more information on how to format your CSV file depending on your targeted SQL Data Type in our SQL Ingest Formatting section.\n⚠️ All interface tables must pre-exist before an insertion. Files in the root produce an error as they do not correspond to a table. The directory structure below the top level does not matter. The first directory in the path is the table; everything else is walked until a file is found. All the data in those files is inserted into the table. The order of the values in each line of a CSV must match the order of the columns in the schema of your interface table unless you were using headers AND specified the \u0026quot;columns\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;foo\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot;], field in your pipeline specification file. Example # \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Tim\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;2017-03-12T21:51:45Z\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; \u0026#34;12\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Tom\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;2017-07-25T21:51:45Z\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; \u0026#34;33\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Tam\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;2017-01-01T21:51:45Z\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;false\u0026#34; \u0026#34;54\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Pach\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;2017-05-15T21:51:45Z\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; ℹ️ Pachyderm queries the schema of the interface tables before insertion then parses the data into their SQL data types. Each insertion creates a new row in your table.

		"body": " ⚠️ Pachyderm uses FUSE to mount repositories as local filesystems. Because Apple has announced phasing out support for macOS kernel extensions, including FUSE, this functionality is no longer stable on macOS Catalina (10.15) or later.\nPachyderm enables you to mount a repository as a local filesystem on your computer by using the pachctl mount command. This command uses the Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) user interface to export a Pachyderm File System (PFS) to a Unix computer system. This functionality is useful when you want to pull data locally to experiment, review the results of a pipeline, or modify the files in the input repository directly.\nYou can mount a Pachyderm repo in one of the following modes:\nRead-only — you can read the mounted files to further experiment with them locally, but cannot modify them. Read-write — you can read mounted files, modify their contents, and push them back into your centralized Pachyderm input repositories. Prerequisites # You must have the following configured for this functionality to work:\nUnix or Unix-like operating system, such as Ubuntu 16.04 or macOS Yosemite or later.\nFUSE for your operating system installed:\nOn macOS, run:\nbrew install osxfuse On Ubuntu, run:\nsudo apt-get install -y fuse For more information, see:\nFUSE for macOS\nMounting Repositories in Read-Only Mode # By default, Pachyderm mounts all repositories in read-only mode. You can access the files through your file browser or enable third-party applications access. Read-only access enables you to explore and experiment with the data, without modifying it. For example, you can mount your repo to a local computer and then open that directory in a Jupyter Notebook for exploration.\nℹ️ The pachctl mount command allows you to mount not only the default branch, typically a master branch, but also other Pachyderm branches. By default, Pachyderm mounts the master branch. However, if you add a branch to the name of the repo, the HEAD of that branch will be mounted.\nExample:\npachctl mount images --repos images@staging You can also mount a specific commit, but because commits might be on multiple branches, modifying them might result in data deletion in the HEAD of the branches. Therefore, you can only mount commits in read-only mode. If you want to write to a specific commit that is not the HEAD of a branch, you can create a new branch with that commit as HEAD.\nMounting Repositories in Read-Write Mode # Running the pachctl mount command with the --write flag grants you write access to the mounted repositories, which means that you can open the files for editing and put them back to the Pachyderm repository.\n⚠️ Your changes are saved to the Pachyderm repository only after you interrupt the pachctl mount with CTRL+C or with pachctl unmount, unmount /\u0026lt;path-to-mount\u0026gt;, or fusermount -u /\u0026lt;path-to-mount\u0026gt;.\nFor example, you have the OpenCV example pipeline up and running. If you want to edit files in the images repository, experiment with brightness and contrast settings in liberty.png, and finally have your edges pipeline process those changes. If you do not mount the images repo, you would have to first download the files to your computer, edit them, and then put them back to the repository. The pachctl mount command automates all these steps for you. You can mount just the images repo or all Pachyderm repositories as directories on you machine, edit as needed, and, when done, exit the pachctl mount command. Upon exiting the pachctl mount command, Pachyderm uploads all the changes to the corresponding repository.\nIf someone else modifies the files while you are working on them locally, their changes will likely be overwritten when you exit pachctl mount. This happens because Therefore, make sure that you do not work on the same files while someone else is working on them.\nℹ️ Use writable mount ONLY when you have sole ownership over the mounted data. Otherwise, merge conflicts or unexpected data overwrites can occur.\nBecause output repositories are created by the Pachyderm pipelines, they are immutable. Only a pipeline can change and update files in these repositories. If you try to change a file in an output repo, you will get an error message.\nHow to Mount/Unmount a Pachyderm Repo # To mount a Pachyderm repo on a local computer, complete the following steps:\nIn a terminal, go to a directory in which you want to mount a Pachyderm repo.

For example, the following will mount both repos to the /mydirectory directory. pachctl mount ./mydirectory -r first_repo@master -r second_repo@master You can check that the repo was mounted by running the mount command in your terminal:\nmount /dev/disk1s1 on / (apfs, local, read-only, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) /dev/disk1s2 on /System/Volumes/Data (apfs, local, journaled, nobrowse) /dev/disk1s5 on /private/var/vm (apfs, local, journaled, nobrowse) map auto_home on /System/Volumes/Data/home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) pachctl@osxfuse0 on /Users/testuser/mydirectory (osxfuse, nodev, nosuid, synchronous, mounted by testuser) Access your mountpoint.\nFor example, in macOS, open Finder, press CMD + SHIFT + G, and type the mountpoint location. If you have mounted the repo to ~/mydirectory, type ~/mydirectory.\nEdit the files as needed.\nWhen ready, add your changes to the Pachyderm repo by stopping the pachctl mount command with CTRL+C or by running pachctl unmount \u0026lt;mountpoint\u0026gt; (or unmount /\u0026lt;path-to-mount\u0026gt;, or fusermount -u /\u0026lt;path-to-mount\u0026gt;).\nIf you have mounted a writable Pachyderm share, interrupting the pachctl mount command results in the upload of your changes to the corresponding repo and branch, which is equivalent to running the pachctl put file command. You can check that Pachyderm runs a new job for this work by listing current jobs with pachctl list job.\n",

		"body": "If bad data was committed into a Pachyderm input repository, you might need to delete a commit or surgically delete files from your history. Depending on whether or not the bad data is in the HEAD commit of the branch, you can perform one of the following actions:\nDelete the HEAD of a Branch. If the incorrect data was added in the latest commit and provided that the commit does not have children: Follow the steps in this section to fix the HEAD of the corrupted branch. If your changes are relatively recent (see conditions below), you can delete a particular file, then erase it from your history. Additionally, although this is a separate use-case, you have the option to squash non-HEAD commits to rewrite your commit history.\nDelete the HEAD of a Branch # To fix a broken HEAD, run the following command:\npachctl delete commit \u0026lt;commit-ID\u0026gt; When you delete a HEAD commit, Pachyderm performs the following actions:\nChanges HEADs of all the branches that had the bad commit as their HEAD to their bad commit\u0026rsquo;s parent and deletes the commit. The data in the deleted commit is lost. If the bad commit does not have a parent, Pachyderm sets the branch\u0026rsquo;s HEAD to a new empty commit. Interrupts all running jobs, including not only the jobs that use the bad commit as a direct input but also the ones farther downstream in your DAG. Deletes the output commits from the deleted jobs. All the actions listed above are applied to those commits as well. ⚠️ This command will only succeed if the HEAD commit has no children on any branch. pachctl delete commit will error when attempting to delete a HEAD commit with children.\nℹ️ Are you wondering how a HEAD commit can have children?\nA commit can be the head of a branch and still have children. For instance, given a master branch in a repository named repo, if you branch master by running pachctl create branch repo@staging --head repo@master, the master\u0026rsquo;s HEAD will have an alias child on staging.\nSquash non-HEAD Commits # If your commit has children, you have the option to use the squash commit command. Squashing is a way to rewrite your commit history; this helps clean up and simplify your commit history before sharing your work with team members. Squashing a commit in Pachyderm means that you are combining all the file changes in the commits of a global commit into their children and then removing the global commit. This behavior is inspired by the squash option in git rebase. No data stored in PFS is removed since they remain in the child commits.\npachctl squash commit \u0026lt;commit-ID\u0026gt; ⚠️ Squashing a global commit on the head of a branch (no children) will fail. Use pachctl delete commit instead. Squash commit only applies to user repositories. For example, you cannot squash a commit that updated a pipeline (Commit that lives in a spec repository). Similarly to pachctl delete commit, pachctl squash commit stops (but does not delete) associated jobs. Example # In the simple example below, we create three successive commits on the master branch of a repo repo:\nIn commit ID1, we added files A and B. In commit ID2, we added file C. In commit ID3, the latest commit, we altered the content of files A and C. We then run pachctl squash commit ID1, then pachctl squash commit ID2, and look at our branch and remaining commit(s).\nA’ and C\u0026rsquo; are altered versions of files A and C. At any moment, pachctl list file repo@master invariably returns the same files A’, B, C’. pachctl list commit however, differs in each case, since, by squashing commits, we have deleted them from the branch.\nDelete Files from History # 📖 It is important to note that this use case is limited to simple cases where the \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; changes were made relatively recently, as any pipeline update since then will make it impossible.\nIn rare cases, you might need to delete a particular file from a given commit and further choose to delete its complete history. In such a case, you will need to:\nCreate a new commit in which you surgically remove the problematic file.\nStart a new commit:\npachctl start commit \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt; Delete all corrupted files from the newly opened commit:\npachctl delete file \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;branch or commitID\u0026gt;:/path/to/files Finish the commit:\npachctl finish commit \u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt; Optionally, wipe this file from your history by squashing the initial bad commit and all its children up to the newly finished commit.\nUnless the subsequent commits overwrote or deleted the bad data, the data might still be present in the children commits. Squashing those commits cleans up your commit history and ensures that the errant data is not available when non-HEAD versions of the data are read.\nExample # In the simple example below, we want to delete file C in commit 2. How would we do that?\nFor now, pachctl list file repo@master returns the files A’, B, C’, E, F.\nA’ and C\u0026rsquo; are altered versions of files A and C. We create a new commit in which we surgically remove file C:\npachctl start commit repo@master pachctl delete file repo@master:path/to/C pachctl finish commit repo@master At this point, pachctl list file repo@master returns the files A’, B, E, F. We removed file C. However, it still exists in the commit history.\nTo remove C from the commit history, we squash the commits in which C appears, all the way down to the last commit.\npachctl squash commitID2 pachctl squash commitID3 It is as if C never existed.\n",

This typically indicates that there is an issue with the container that needs to be resolved. FailedScheduling The Kubernetes scheduler is unable to schedule a pod on any node. This typically indicates that there are insufficient resources available in the cluster or that there are constraints set that prevent the pod from being scheduled. OutOfMemory A container in a pod ran out of memory. This typically indicates that the container needs to be reconfigured with more memory or that there is an issue with the application running in the container that is causing it to consume too much memory. FailedCreatePodSandBox The Kubernetes API server failed to create a sandbox for a pod. This typically indicates that there is an issue with the node or the network that is preventing the creation of the sandbox. Evicted A pod is evicted from a node due to resource constraints or other reasons. This typically indicates that the node is running low on resources or that there is an issue with the pod that needs to be resolved. NodeNotReady A node is not ready to accept pods. This can occur due to various reasons such as network connectivity issues or insufficient resources. ImagePullBackOff An image pull operation fails. The container runtime is unable to pull the image from the specified registry or repository. FailedMount A mount operation failed, such as when a volume or configMap failed to mount. This can occur due to incorrect configurations, insufficient permissions, or a missing dependency. ℹ️ These events are just a few of the many events that can occur in Kubernetes. It\u0026rsquo;s important to monitor your cluster for these and other events to ensure the health and stability of your applications.\n",

Both the data and pipeline can be iterated on independently with Pachyderm handling the code execution according to the pipeline specfication. The workflow steps are shown below.\nData Workflow # Adding data to Pachyderm is the first step towards building data-driven pipelines. There are multiple ways to add data to a Pachyderm repository:\nBy using the pachctl put file command By using a special type of pipeline, such as a spout or cron By using one of the Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s language clients By using a compatible S3 client For more information, see Load Your Data Into Pachyderm.\nPipeline Workflow # The fundamental concepts of Pachyderm are very powerful, but the manual build steps mentioned in the pipeline workflow can become cumbersome during rapid-iteration development cycles. We\u0026rsquo;ve created a few helpful developer workflows and tools to automate steps that are error-prone or repetitive:\nThe push images flag or --push-images is a optional flag that can be passed to the create or update pipeline command. This option is most useful when you need to customize your Docker image or are iterating on the Docker image and code together, since it tags and pushes the image before updating the pipeline. CI/CD Integration provides a way to incorporate Pachyderm functions into the CI process. This is most useful when working with a complex project or for code collaboration. ",

		"body": "Pachyderm is a powerful system for providing data provenance and scalable processing to data scientists and engineers. You can make it even more powerful by integrating it with your existing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows and systems. If you are just starting to use Pachyderm and not setting up automation for your Pachyderm build processes, see Working with Pipelines.\nThe following diagram demonstrates automated Pachyderm development workflow with CI:\nAlthough initial CI setup might require extra effort on your side, in the long run, it brings significant benefits to your team, including the following:\nSimplified workflow for data scientists. Data scientists do not need to be aware of the complexity of the underlying containerized infrastructure. They can follow an established Git process, and the CI platform takes care of the Docker build and push process behind the scenes.\nYour CI platform can run additional unit tests against the submitted code before creating the build.\nFlexibility in tagging Docker images, such as specifying a custom name and tag or using the commit SHA for tagging.\nCI Workflow # The CI workflow includes the following steps:\nA new commit triggers a Git hook.\nTypically, Pachyderm users store the following artifacts in a Git repository:\nA Dockerfile that you use to build local images. A pipeline.json specification file that you can use in a Makefile to create local builds, as well as in the CI/CD workflows. The code that performs data transformations. A commit hook in Git for your repository triggers the CI/CD process. It uses the information in your pipeline specification for subsequent steps.\nBuild an image.\nYour CI process automatically starts the build of a Docker container image based on your code and the Dockerfile.\nPush the image tagged with commit ID to an image registry.\nYour CI process pushes a Docker image created in Step 2 to your preferred image registry. When a data scientist submits their code to Git, a CI process uses the Dockerfile in the repository to build, tag with a Git commit SHA, and push the container to your image registry.\nUpdate the pipeline spec with the tagged image.\nIn this step, your CI/CD infrastructure uses your updated pipeline.json specification and fills in the Git commit SHA for the version of the image that must be used in this pipeline. Then, it runs the pachctl update pipeline command to push the updated pipeline specification to Pachyderm. After that, Pachyderm pulls a new image from the registry automatically. When the production pipeline is updated with the pipeline.json file that has the correct image tag in it, Pachyderm restarts all pods for this pipeline with the new image automatically.\nGitHub Actions # GitHub actions are a convenient way to kick off workflows and perform integration. These can be used to:\nManually trigger a pipeline build, or Automatically build a pipeline from a commit or pull request. In our example, we show how to use the Pachyderm GitHub Action to incorporate Pachyderm functions to run on a Pull Request or at other points during development.\n",

		"body": "Because Pachyderm is a language and framework agnostic and platform, and because it easily distributes analysis over large data sets, data scientists can use any tooling for creating machine learning workflows. Even if that tooling is not familiar to the rest of an engineering organization, data scientists can autonomously develop and deploy scalable solutions by using containers. Moreover, Pachyderm’s pipeline logic paired with data versioning make any results reproducible for debugging purposes or during the development of improvements to a model.\nFor maximum leverage of Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s built functionality, Pachyderm recommends that you combine model training processes, persisted models, and model utilization processes, such as making inferences or generating results, into a single Pachyderm pipeline Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\nSuch a pipeline enables you to achieve the following goals:\nKeep a rigorous historical record of which models were used on what data to produce which results. Automatically update online ML models when training data or parameterization changes. Easily revert to other versions of an ML model when a new model does not produce an expected result or when bad data is introduced into a training data set. The following diagram demonstrates an ML pipeline:\nYou can update the training dataset at any time to automatically train a new persisted model. Also, you can use any language or framework, including Apache Spark™, Tensorflow™, scikit-learn™, or other, and output any format of persisted model, such as pickle, XML, POJO, or other. Regardless of the framework, Pachyderm versions the model so that you can track the data that was used to train each model.\nPachyderm processes new data coming into the input repository with the updated model. Also, you can recompute old predictions with the updated model, or test new models on previously input and versioned data. This feature enables you to avoid manual updates to historical results or swapping ML models in production.\nFor examples of ML workflows in Pachyderm see Machine Learning Examples.\n",

		"body": "A typical Pachyderm workflow involves multiple iterations of experimenting with your code and pipeline specs.\n📖 Before you read this section, make sure that you understand basic Pachyderm pipeline concepts described in Concepts.\nIn general, there are five steps to working with a pipeline. The stages can be summarized in the image below.\nWe will walk through each of the stages in detail.\nStep 1: Write Your Analysis Code # Because Pachyderm is completely language-agnostic, the code that is used to process data in Pachyderm can be written in any language and can use any libraries of choice. Whether your code is as simple as a bash command or as complicated as a TensorFlow neural network, it needs to be built with all the required dependencies into a container that can run anywhere, including inside of Pachyderm. See Examples.\nYour code does not have to import any special Pachyderm functionality or libraries. However, it must meet the following requirements:\nRead files from a local file system. Pachyderm automatically mounts each input data repository as /pfs/\u0026lt;repo_name\u0026gt; in the running containers of your Docker image. Therefore, the code that you write needs to read input data from this directory, similar to any other file system.\nBecause Pachyderm automatically spreads data across parallel containers, your analysis code does not have to deal with data sharding or parallelization. For example, if you have four containers that run your Python code, Pachyderm automatically supplies 1/4 of the input data to /pfs/\u0026lt;repo_name\u0026gt; in each running container. These workload balancing settings can be adjusted as needed through Pachyderm tunable parameters in the pipeline specification.\nWrite files into a local file system, such as saving results. Your code must write to the /pfs/out directory that Pachyderm mounts in all of your running containers. Similar to reading data, your code does not have to manage parallelization or sharding.\nStep 2: Build Your Docker Image # When you create a Pachyderm pipeline, you need to specify a Docker image that includes the code or binary that you want to run. Therefore, every time you modify your code, you need to build a new Docker image, push it to your image registry, and update the image tag in the pipeline spec. This section describes one way of building Docker images, but if you have your own routine, feel free to apply it.\nTo build an image, you need to create a Dockerfile. However, do not use the CMD field in your Dockerfile to specify the commands that you want to run. Instead, you add them in the cmd field in your pipeline specification. Pachyderm runs these commands inside the container during the job execution rather than relying on Docker to run them. The reason is that Pachyderm cannot execute your code immediately when your container starts, so it runs a shim process in your container instead, and then, it calls your pipeline specification\u0026rsquo;s cmd from there.\nℹ️ The Dockerfile example below is provided for your reference only. Your Dockerfile might look completely different.\nTo build a Docker image, complete the following steps:\nIf you do not have a registry, create one with a preferred provider. If you decide to use DockerHub, follow the Docker Hub Quickstart to create a repository for your project.\nCreate a Dockerfile for your project. See the OpenCV example.\nBuild a new image from the Dockerfile by specifying a tag:\ndocker build -t \u0026lt;image\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt; . For more information about building Docker images, see Docker documentation.\nStep 3: Push Your Docker Image to a Registry # Once your image is built and tagged, you need to upload the image into a public or private image registry, such as DockerHub.\nAlternatively, you can use the Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s built-in functionality to tag, and push images by running the pachctl update pipeline command with the --push-images flag. For more information, see Update a pipeline.\nLog in to an image registry.\nIf you use DockerHub, run:\ndocker login --username=\u0026lt;dockerhub-username\u0026gt; --password=\u0026lt;dockerhub-password\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dockerhub-fqdn\u0026gt; Push your image to your image registry.\nIf you use DockerHub, run:\ndocker push \u0026lt;image\u0026gt;:tag ℹ️ Pipelines require a unique tag to ensure the appropriate image is pulled. If a floating tag, such as latest, is used, the Kubernetes cluster may become out of sync with the Docker registry, concluding it already has the latest image.\nStep 4: Create/Edit the Pipeline Config # Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s pipeline specification files store the configuration information about the Docker image and code that Pachyderm should run, the input repo(s) of the pipeline, parallelism settings, GPU usage etc\u0026hellip; Pipeline specifications are stored in JSON or YAML format.\nA standard pipeline specification must include the following parameters:\nname transform input ℹ️ Some special types of pipelines, such as a spout pipeline, do not require you to specify all of these parameters. Spout pipelines, for example, do not have input repos.\nCheck our reference pipeline specification page, for a list of all available fields in a pipeline specification file.\nYou can store your pipeline specifications locally or in a remote location, such as a GitHub repository.\nA simple pipeline specification file in JSON would look like the example below. The pipeline takes its data from the input repo data, runs worker containers with the defined image \u0026lt;image\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt; and command, then outputs the resulting processed data in the my-pipeline output repo. During a job execution, each worker sees and reads from the local file system /pfs/data containing only matched data from the glob expression, and writes its output to /pfs/out with standard file system functions; Pachyderm handles the rest.\n# my-pipeline.json { \u0026#34;pipeline\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-pipeline\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;transform\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;image\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;tag\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cmd\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;command\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/pfs/data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/pfs/out\u0026#34;] }, \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34; } } } Step 5: Deploy/Update the Pipeline # As soon as you create a pipeline, Pachyderm spins up one or more Kubernetes pods in which the pipeline code runs. By default, after the pipeline finishes running, the pods continue to run while waiting for the new data to be committed into the Pachyderm input repository. You can configure this parameter, as well as many others, in the pipeline specification.\nCreate a Pachyderm pipeline from the spec:\npachctl create pipeline -f my-pipeline.json You can specify a local file or a file stored in a remote location, such as a GitHub repository. For example, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/2.5.x/examples/opencv/edges.json.\nIf your pipeline specification changes, you can update the pipeline by running\npachctl update pipeline -f my-pipeline.json ℹ️ \u0026ldquo;See Also:\u0026rdquo; - Updating Pipelines - Advanced users, parameterize your pipeline specifications with Jsonnet pipeline specification files.\n",

Pachyderm deletes the user output repository with all its data as well as the system meta (stats) and spec (historical versions of the pipeline specification file) repositories. Check our Repositories concept page for more details on repositories types. ℹ️ If you are using Pachyderm authorization features, only authorized users will be able to delete a given pipeline. In particular, they will have to be repoOwner of the output repo of the pipeline (i.e., have created the pipeline) or clusterAdmin.\nYou can use the --keep-repo flag to preserve the output repo with all its branches. However, important job metadata will still be deleted (including all historical versions of the pipeline specification file). As a result, you will not be able to recreate the deleted pipeline with the same name unless that repo is deleted first.\nExample # For example, if a pipeline \u0026ldquo;xyz\u0026rdquo; exists, then there is an output repo \u0026ldquo;xyz\u0026rdquo;.

For the pipeline creation to be successful, the user would have to delete repo \u0026ldquo;xyz\u0026rdquo; first.\nℹ️ You can use the output repo of a pipeline deleted with --keep-repo as an input repo and add more data.\nWhen Pachyderm cannot delete a pipeline with the standard command, you might need to enforce deletion using the --force flag.

		"body": " ⚠️ Jsonnet pipeline specifications is an experimental feature.\nPachyderm pipeline\u0026rsquo;s specification files are intuitive, simple, and language agnostic. They are, however, very static.\nA jsonnet pipeline specification file is a thin wrapping layer atop of your JSON file, allowing you to parameterize a pipeline specification file, thus adding a dynamic component to the creation and update of pipelines.\nWith jsonnet pipeline specs, you can easily reuse the baseline of a given pipeline spec while experimenting with various values of given fields.\nJsonnet Specs # Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s Jsonnet pipeline specs are written in the open-source templating language jsonnet. Jsonnet wraps the baseline of a JSON file into a function, allowing the injection of parameters to a pipeline specification file.\nAll jsonnet pipeline specs have a .jsonnet extension.\nAs an example, check the file edges.jsonnet below. It is a parameterized version of the edges pipeline spec edges.json in the opencv example, used to inject a name modifier and an input repository name into the original pipeline specifications.\nExample 1 # In this snippet of edges.jsonnet, the parameter src sits in place of what would have been the value of the field repo, as a placeholder for any parameter that will be passed to the Jsonnet pipeline spec.\ninput: { pfs: { name: \u0026#34;images\u0026#34;, glob: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34;, repo: src, } }, See the full edges.jsonnet here:\n//// // Template arguments: // // suffix : An arbitrary suffix appended to the name of this pipeline, for // disambiguation when multiple instances are created. // src : the repo from which this pipeline will read the images to which // it applies edge detection. //// function(suffix, src) { pipeline: { name: \u0026#34;edges-\u0026#34;+suffix }, description: \u0026#34;OpenCV edge detection on \u0026#34;+src, input: { pfs: { name: \u0026#34;images\u0026#34;, glob: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34;, repo: src, } }, transform: { cmd: [ \u0026#34;python3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/edges.py\u0026#34; ], image: \u0026#34;pachyderm/opencv:0.0.1\u0026#34; } } Or check our full \u0026ldquo;jsonnet-ed\u0026rdquo; opencv example.\nTo create or update a pipeline using a jsonnet pipeline specification file:\nadd the --jsonnet flag to your pipeline create or pipeline update commands, followed by a local path to your jsonnet file or an url. add --arg \u0026lt;parameter-name\u0026gt;=value for each variable. Example 2 # pachctl create pipeline --jsonnet jsonnet/edges.jsonnet --arg suffix=1 --arg src=images The command above will generate a JSON file named edges-1.json then create a pipeline of the same name taking the repository images as its input.\n📖 Read Jsonnet\u0026rsquo;s complete standard library documentation to learn about all the variables types, string manipulation and mathematical functions, or assertions available to you.\nAt the minimum, your function should always have a parameter that acts as a name modifier. Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s pipeline names are unique. You can quickly generate several pipelines from the same jsonnet pipeline specification file by adding a prefix or a suffix to its generic name.\n📖 Your .jsonnet file can create multiple pipelines at once as illustrated in our group example.\nUse Cases # Using jsonnet pipeline specifications, you could pass different images to the transform section of an otherwise identical JSON specification file to train multiple models on the same dataset, or switch between one input repo holding test data to another holding production data by parameterizing the input repo field.\nDuring the development phase of a pipeline, it can be helpful to pass the tag of an image as a parameter: each re-build of the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s code requires you to increment your tag value; passing it as a parameter will save you the time to update your JSON specifications. You could also consider preparing a library of ready-made jsonnet pipeline specs for data science teams to instantiate, according to their own set of parameters.\nWe will let you imagine more use cases in which those jsonnet specs can be helpful to you.\n",

		"body": "While working with your data, you often need to modify an existing pipeline with new transformation code or pipeline parameters.\nUse the pachctl update pipeline command to make changes to a pipeline, whether you have re-built a docker image after a code change and/or need to update pipeline parameters in the pipeline specification file.\nAlternatively, you can update a pipeline using jsonnet pipeline specification files.\nAfter You Changed Your Specification File # Run the pachctl update pipeline command to apply any change to your pipeline specification JSON file, such as change to the parallelism settings, change of an image tag, change of an input repository, etc\u0026hellip;\nBy default, a pipeline update does not trigger the reprocessing of the data that has already been processed. Instead, it processes only the new data you submit to the input repo. If you want to run the changes in your pipeline against the data in your input repo\u0026rsquo;s HEAD commit, use the --reprocess flag. The updated pipeline will then continue to process new input data only. Previous results remain accessible through the corresponding commit IDs.\nTo update a pipeline, run the following command after you have updated your pipeline specification JSON file.\npachctl update pipeline -f pipeline.json ℹ️ Similar to create pipeline, update pipeline with the -f flag can take a URL if your JSON manifest is hosted on GitHub or other remote location.\nUsing Jsonnet Pipeline Specification Files # Jsonnet pipeline specs allow you to bypass the \u0026ldquo;update-your -specification-file\u0026rdquo; step and apply your changes at once by running:\npachctl update pipeline --jsonnet \u0026lt;your jsonnet pipeline specs path or URL\u0026gt; --arg \u0026lt;param 1\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;value 1\u0026gt; --arg \u0026lt;param 2\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;value 2\u0026gt; Example # pachctl update pipeline --jsonnet jsonnet/edges.jsonnet --arg suffix=1 --arg tag=1.0.2 Update the Code in a Pipeline # To update the code in your pipeline, complete the following steps:\nMake the code changes.\nVerify that the Docker daemon is running. Depending on your operating system and the Docker distribution that you use, steps for enabling it might vary:\ndocker ps If you get an error message similar to the following:\nCannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running? enable the Docker daemon (see the Docker documentation for your operating system and platform). For example, if you use minikube on macOS, run the following command:\neval $(minikube docker-env) Then build, tag, and push the new image to your image registry and update the pipeline. This step comes in 3 flavors:\nIf you prefer to use instructions from your image registry # Build, tag, and push a new image as described in your image registry documentation. For example, if you use DockerHub, see Docker Documentation.\nUpdate the transform.image field of your pipeline spec with your new tag.\n💡 Make sure to update your tag every time you re-build. Our pull policy is IfNotPresent (Only pull the image if it does not already exist on the node.). Failing to update your tag will result in your pipeline running on a previous version of your code.\nUpdate the pipeline:\npachctl update pipeline -f \u0026lt;pipeline.json\u0026gt; If you chose to use a jsonnet version of your pipeline specs # Pass the tag of your image to your jsonnet specs.\nAs an example, see the tag parameter in this jsonnet version of opencv\u0026rsquo;s edges pipeline (edges.jsonnet):\n//// // Template arguments: // // suffix : An arbitrary suffix appended to the name of this pipeline, for // disambiguation when multiple instances are created. // src : the repo from which this pipeline will read the images to which // it applies edge detection. //// function(suffix, src) { pipeline: { name: \u0026#34;edges-\u0026#34;+suffix }, description: \u0026#34;OpenCV edge detection on \u0026#34;+src, input: { pfs: { name: \u0026#34;images\u0026#34;, glob: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34;, repo: src, } }, transform: { cmd: [ \u0026#34;python3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/edges.py\u0026#34; ], image: \u0026#34;pachyderm/opencv:0.0.1\u0026#34; } } Once your pipeline code is updated and your image is built, tagged, and pushed, update your pipeline using this command line. In this case, there is no need to edit the pipeline specification file to update the value of your new tag. This command will take care of it:\npachctl update pipeline --jsonnet jsonnet/edges.jsonnet --arg suffix=1 --arg tag=1.0.2 If you use Pachyderm commands # Build your new image using docker build (for example, in a makefile: @docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t $(DOCKER_ACCOUNT)/$(CONTAINER_NAME) .). No tag needed, the folllowing --push-images flag will take care of it.\nRun the following command:\npachctl update pipeline -f \u0026lt;pipeline name\u0026gt; --push-images --registry \u0026lt;registry\u0026gt; --username \u0026lt;registry user\u0026gt; If you use DockerHub, omit the --registry flag.\nExample:\npachctl update pipeline -f edges.json --push-images --username testuser When prompted, type your image registry password:\nExample:\nPassword for docker.io/testuser: Building pachyderm/opencv:f1e0239fce5441c483b09de425f06b40, this may take a while.

		"body": "Projects are logical collections of related work (such as repos and pipelines). Each Pachyderm cluster ships with an initial project named default. PachCTL supports all Project operations, such as adding/removing team members, resources, etc. Pachyderm Console can be used to view and access Projects. Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s integrations with JupyterLab, Seldon, S3 Gateway, and DeterminedAI also support projects.\nBenefits of Projects # Logical Organization of DAGs: Similar to a file system, you can organize your work within a Pachyderm instance.\nStandardizable: Resources like repos can have the same name if they belong to different projects, making it easier to create and adhere to project templates in a collaborative environment. For example, ProjectA.Repo1 and ProjectB.Repo1.\nMulti-team Enablement: With Enterprise Pachyderm, You can grant access to projects based on roles; projects are hidden from users without access by default.\nExample # In the following example there are two projects: DOGS and CATS. They have similarly named repositories and pipelines.

		"body": "This article walks you through deploying a Pachyderm cluster on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).\nArchitecture Diagram # Before You Start # Before you can deploy Pachyderm on an EKS cluster, verify that you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:\nkubectl AWS CLI eksctl aws-iam-authenticator. pachctl 1. Deploy Kubernetes by using eksctl # ⚠️ Pachyderm requires running your cluster on Kubernetes 1.19.0 and above.\nUse the eksctl tool to deploy an EKS cluster in your Amazon AWS environment. The eksctl create cluster command creates a virtual private cloud (VPC), a security group, and an IAM role for Kubernetes to create resources. For detailed instructions, see Amazon documentation.\nTo deploy an EKS cluster, complete the following steps:\nDeploy an EKS cluster:\neksctl create cluster --name \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; --version \u0026lt;version\u0026gt; \\ --nodegroup-name \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; --node-type \u0026lt;vm-flavor\u0026gt; \\ --nodes \u0026lt;number-of-nodes\u0026gt; --nodes-min \u0026lt;min-number-nodes\u0026gt; \\ --nodes-max \u0026lt;max-number-nodes\u0026gt; --node-ami auto Example\neksctl create cluster --name pachyderm-cluster --region us-east-2 --profile \u0026lt;your named profile\u0026gt; Verify the deployment:\nkubectl get all System Response:\nNAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/kubernetes ClusterIP 10.100.0.1 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 443/TCP 23h Once your Kubernetes cluster is up, and your infrastructure is configured, you are ready to prepare for the installation of Pachyderm. Some of the steps below will require you to keep updating the values.yaml started during the setup of the recommended infrastructure.\nℹ️ Pachyderm recommends securing and managing your secrets in a Secret Manager. Learn about the set up and configuration of your EKS cluster to retrieve the relevant secrets from AWS Secrets Manager then resume the following installation steps.\n2. Create an S3 bucket # Create an S3 object store bucket for data # Pachyderm needs an S3 bucket (Object store) to store your data. You can create the bucket by running the following commands:\n⚠️ The S3 bucket name must be globally unique across the entire Amazon region.\nSet up the following system variables:\nBUCKET_NAME — A globally unique S3 bucket name. AWS_REGION — The AWS region of your Kubernetes cluster. For example, us-west-2 and not us-west-2a. If you are creating an S3 bucket in the us-east-1 region, run the following command:\naws s3api create-bucket --bucket ${BUCKET_NAME} --region ${AWS_REGION} If you are creating an S3 bucket in any region but the us-east-1 region, run the following command:\naws s3api create-bucket --bucket ${BUCKET_NAME} --region ${AWS_REGION} --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=${AWS_REGION} Verify that the S3 bucket was created:\naws s3 ls You now need to give Pachyderm access to your bucket either by:\nAdding a policy to your service account IAM Role (Recommended) OR Passing your AWS credentials (account ID and KEY) to your values.yaml when installing 📖 IAM roles provide finer grained user management and security capabilities than access keys. Pachyderm recommends the use of IAM roles for production deployments.\nAdd An IAM Role And Policy To Your Service Account # Before you can make sure that the containers in your pods have the right permissions to access your S3 bucket, you will need to Create an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster.\nThen follow the steps detailled in Create an IAM Role And Policy for your Service Account.\nIn short, you will:\nRetrieve your OpenID Connect provider URL:\nGo to the AWS Management console. Select your cluster instance in Amazon EKS. In the Configuration tab of your EKS cluster, find your OpenID Connect provider URL and save it. You will need it when creating your IAM Role. Create an IAM policy that gives access to your bucket:\nCreate a new Policy from your IAM Console. Select the JSON tab. Copy/Paste the following text in the JSON tab: { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;s3:ListBucket\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::\u0026lt;your-bucket\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ]},{ \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;s3:PutObject\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;s3:GetObject\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;s3:DeleteObject\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::\u0026lt;your-bucket\u0026gt;/*\u0026#34; ]} ] } Replace \u0026lt;your-bucket\u0026gt; with the name of your S3 bucket.\nCreate an IAM role as a Web Identity using the cluster OIDC procider as the identity provider.\nCreate a new Role from your IAM Console. Select the Web identity Tab. In the Identity Provider drop down, select the OpenID Connect provider URL of your EKS and sts.amazonaws.com as the Audience. Attach the newly created permission to the Role. Name it. Retrieve the Role arn. You will need it in your values.yaml annotations when deploying Pachyderm. (Optional) Set Up Bucket Encryption # To set up bucket encryption, see Amazon S3 Default Encryption for S3 Buckets.\n3. Enable Your Persistent Volumes Creation # etcd and PostgreSQL (metadata storage) each claim the creation of a persistent volume.\nCreate an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster. Install the Amazon EBS Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver on your cluster. Create a gp3 storage class manifest file (e.g., gp3-storageclass.yaml) kind: StorageClass apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: gp3 annotations: storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs parameters: type: gp3 fsType: ext4 Set gp3 to your default storage class. kubectl apply -f gp3-storageclass.yaml Verify that it has been set as your default. kubectl get storageclass 💡 If you need to mark a StorageClass as non-default, use the following:\nkubectl patch storageclass \u0026lt;storageclass-name\u0026gt; -p \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;annotations\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;}}}\u0026#39; 4. Create an AWS Managed PostgreSQL Database # By default, Pachyderm runs with a bundled version of PostgreSQL. For production environments, it is strongly recommended that you disable the bundled version and use an RDS PostgreSQL instance.\n⚠️ Note that Aurora Serverless PostgreSQL is not supported and will not work.\nCreate An RDS Instance # 📖 Find the details of all the steps highlighted below in AWS Documentation: \u0026ldquo;Getting Started\u0026rdquo; hands-on tutorial.\nIn the RDS console, create a database in the region matching your Pachyderm cluster. Choose the PostgreSQL engine. Select a PostgreSQL version \u0026gt;= 13.3. Configure your DB instance as follows: SETTING Recommended value DB instance identifier Fill in with a unique name across all of your DB instances in the current region. Master username Choose your Admin username. Master password Choose your Admin password. DB instance class The standard default should work. You can change the instance type later on to optimize your performances and costs. Storage type and Allocated storage If you select io1, keep the 100 GiB default size. Read more information on Storage for RDS on Amazon\u0026rsquo;s website. Storage autoscaling If your workload is cyclical or unpredictable, enable storage autoscaling to allow RDS to scale up your storage when needed. Standby instance We highly recommend creating a standby instance for production environments. VPC Select the VPC of your Kubernetes cluster. Attention: After a database is created, you can\u0026rsquo;t change its VPC. Read more on VPCs and RDS on Amazon documentation. Subnet group Pick a Subnet group or Create a new one. Read more about DB Subnet Groups on Amazon documentation. Public access Set the Public access to No for production environments. VPC security group Create a new VPC security group and open the postgreSQL port or use an existing one. Password authentication or Password and IAM database authentication Choose one or the other. Database name In the Database options section, enter Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s Database name (We are using pachyderm in this example.) and click Create database to create your PostgreSQL service. Your instance is running. Warning: If you do not specify a database name, Amazon RDS does not create a database. If you plan to deploy a standalone cluster (i.e., if you do not plan to register your cluster with a separate enterprise server, you must create a second database named dex in your RDS instance for Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s authentication service. Read more about dex on PostgreSQL in Dex\u0026rsquo;s documentation.\nAdditionally, create a new user account and grant it full CRUD permissions to both pachyderm and (when applicable) dex databases. Read about managing PostgreSQL users and roles in this blog. Pachyderm will use the same username to connect to pachyderm as well as to dex.\nUpdate your values.yaml # Once your databases have been created, add the following fields to your Helm values:\nglobal: postgresql: postgresqlUsername: \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; postgresqlPassword: \u0026#34;password\u0026#34; # The name of the database should be Pachyderm\u0026#39;s (\u0026#34;pachyderm\u0026#34; in the example above), not \u0026#34;dex\u0026#34; # See also # postgresqlExistingSecretName: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;yoursecretname\u0026gt;\u0026#34; postgresqlDatabase: \u0026#34;databasename\u0026#34; # The postgresql database host to connect to.

You are ready to create your instance.\nExample # az postgres server create \\ --resource-group \u0026lt;your_resource_group\u0026gt; \\ --name \u0026lt;your_server_name\u0026gt; \\ --location westus \\ --sku-name GP_Gen5_2 \\ --admin-user \u0026lt;server_admin_username\u0026gt; \\ --admin-password \u0026lt;server_admin_password\u0026gt; \\ --ssl-enforcement Disabled \\ --version 11 📖 For detailed steps, see the official Azure documentation.\n⚠️ Make sure that your PostgreSQL version is \u0026gt;= 11 Keep the SSL setting Disabled. Once created, go back to your newly created database, and:\nOpen the access to your instance: ℹ️ Azure provides two options for pods running on an AKS worker nodes to access a PostgreSQL DB instance, pick what fit you best:\nCreate a firewall rule on the Azure DB Server with a range of IP addresses that encompasses all IPs of the AKS Cluster nodes (this can be a very large range if using node auto-scaling). Create a VNet Rule on the Azure DB Server that allows access from the subnet the AKS nodes are in. This is used in conjunction with the Microsoft.Sql VNet Service Endpoint enabled on the cluster subnet. You can also choose the more secure option to deny public access to your PostgreSQL instance then Create a private endpoint in the K8s vnet. Read more about how to configure a private link using CLI on Azure\u0026rsquo;s documentation\nAlternativelly, in the Connection Security of your newly created server, Allow access to Azure services (This is equivalent to running az postgres server firewall-rule create --server-name \u0026lt;your_server_name\u0026gt; --resource-group \u0026lt;your_resource_group\u0026gt; --name AllowAllAzureIps --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 --end-ip-address 0.0.0.0).\nIn the Essentials page of your instance, find the full server name and admin username that will be required in your values.yaml. Create Your Databases # After your instance is created, you will need to create Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s database(s).\nIf you plan to deploy a standalone cluster (i.e., if you do not plan to register your cluster with a separate enterprise server, you will need to create a second database named \u0026ldquo;dex\u0026rdquo; in your PostgreSQL Server instance for Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s authentication service. Note that the database must be named dex. This second database is not needed when your cluster is managed by an enterprise server.\nℹ️ Read more about dex on PostgreSQL in Dex\u0026rsquo;s documentation.\nPachyderm will use the same user to connect to pachyderm as well as to dex.\nUpdate your yaml values # Once your databases have been created, add the following fields to your Helm values:\nglobal: postgresql: postgresqlUsername: \u0026#34;see admin username above\u0026#34; postgresqlPassword: \u0026#34;password\u0026#34; # The server name of the instance postgresqlDatabase: \u0026#34;pachyderm\u0026#34; # The postgresql database host to connect to. postgresqlHost: \u0026#34;see server name above\u0026#34; # The postgresql database port to connect to.

		"body": "You can define environment variables that handle required configuration. In Pachyderm, you can define the following types of environment variables:\npachd variables: Used for your Pachyderm daemon container.\nPachyderm worker variables: Used by the Kubernetes pods that run your pipeline code.\n💡 You can reference environment variables in your code. For example, if your code writes data to an external system and you want to know the current job ID, you can use the PACH_JOB_ID environment variable to refer to the current job ID.\npachd Environment Variables # You can find the list of pachd environment variables in the pachd manifest by running the following command:\nkubectl get deploy pachd -o yaml The following tables list all the pachd environment variables.\nGlobal Configuration # Environment Variable Default Value Description ETCD_SERVICE_HOST N/A The host on which the etcd service runs. ETCD_SERVICE_PORT N/A The etcd port number. PPS_WORKER_GRPC_PORT 80 The GRPs port number. PORT 650 The pachd port number. HTTP_PORT 652 The HTTP port number. PEER_PORT 653 The port for pachd-to-pachd communication. NAMESPACE deafult The namespace in which Pachyderm is deployed. pachd Configuration # Environment Variable Default Value Description NUM_SHARDS 32 The max number of pachd pods that can run in a single cluster. STORAGE_BACKEND \u0026quot;\u0026quot; The storage backend defined for the Pachyderm cluster. STORAGE_HOST_PATH \u0026quot;\u0026quot; The host path to storage. KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR none An IP address that Kubernetes exports automatically for your code to communicate with the Kubernetes API. Read access only. Most variables that have use the PORT_ADDRESS_TCP_ADDR pattern are Kubernetes environment variables. For more information,\nsee Kubernetes environment variables. METRICS true Defines whether anonymous Pachyderm metrics are being collected or not. BLOCK_CACHE_BYTES 1G The size of the block cache in pachd. WORKER_IMAGE \u0026quot;\u0026quot; The base Docker image that is used to run your pipeline. WORKER_SIDECAR_IMAGE \u0026quot;\u0026quot; The pachd image that is used as a worker sidecar. WORKER_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY IfNotPresent The pull policy that defines how Docker images are pulled. You can set a Kubernetes image pull policy as needed. LOG_LEVEL info Verbosity of the log output. If you want to disable logging, set this variable to 0. Viable Options debug info error\nFor more information, see Go logrus log levels. IAM_ROLE \u0026quot;\u0026quot; The role that defines permissions for Pachyderm in AWS. IMAGE_PULL_SECRET \u0026quot;\u0026quot; The Kubernetes secret for image pull credentials. EXPOSE_OBJECT_API false Controls access to internal Pachyderm API. WORKER_USES_ROOT true Controls root access in the worker container. S3GATEWAY_PORT 600 The S3 gateway port number DISABLE_COMMIT_PROGRESS_COUNTER false A feature flag that disables commit propagation progress counter. If you have a large DAG, setting this parameter to true might help improve etcd performance. You only need to set this parameter on the pachd pod. Pachyderm passes this parameter to worker containers automatically. Storage Configuration # Environment Variable Default Value Description STORAGE_MEMORY_THRESHOLD N/A Defines the storage memory threshold. STORAGE_SHARD_THRESHOLD N/A Defines the storage shard threshold. Pipeline Worker Environment Variables # Pachyderm defines many environment variables for each Pachyderm worker that runs your pipeline code. You can print the list of environment variables into your Pachyderm logs by including the env command into your pipeline specification. For example, if you have an images repository, you can configure your pipeline specification like this:\n{ \u0026#34;pipeline\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;env\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;input\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;pfs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;glob\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;repo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;images\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;transform\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;cmd\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;sh\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;stdin\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;env\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ubuntu:14.04\u0026#34; } } Run this pipeline and upon completion you can view the log with variables by running the following command:\npachctl logs --pipeline=env PPS_WORKER_IP=172.17.0.7 DASH_PORT_8081_TCP_PROTO=tcp PACHD_PORT_600_TCP_PORT=600 KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=443 KUBERNETES_PORT=tcp://10.96.0.1:443 ... You should see a lengthy list of variables. Many of them define internal networking parameters that most probably you will not need to use.\nMost users find the following environment variables particularly useful:\nEnvironment Variable Description PACH_JOB_ID The ID of the current job. For example, PACH_JOB_ID=8991d6e811554b2a8eccaff10ebfb341. PACH_DATUM_ID The ID of the current Datum. PACH_DATUM_\u0026lt;input.name\u0026gt;_JOIN_ON Exposes the join_on match to the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s job. PACH_DATUM_\u0026lt;input.name\u0026gt;_GROUP_BY Expose the group_by match to the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s job. PACH_OUTPUT_COMMIT_ID The ID of the commit in the output repo for the current job. For example, PACH_OUTPUT_COMMIT_ID=a974991ad44d4d37ba5cf33b9ff77394. PPS_NAMESPACE The PPS namespace. For example, PPS_NAMESPACE=default. PPS_SPEC_COMMIT The hash of the pipeline specification commit.\nThis value is tied to the pipeline version. Therefore, jobs that use the same version of the same pipeline have the same spec commit. For example, PPS_SPEC_COMMIT=3596627865b24c4caea9565fcde29e7d. PPS_POD_NAME The name of the pipeline pod. For example, pipeline-env-v1-zbwm2. PPS_PIPELINE_NAME The name of the pipeline that this pod runs. For example, env. PIPELINE_SERVICE_PORT_PROMETHEUS_METRICS The port that you can use to exposed metrics to Prometheus from within your pipeline. The default value is 9090. HOME The path to the home directory. The default value is /root \u0026lt;input-repo\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;path/to/input/repo\u0026gt; The path to the filesystem that is defined in the input in your pipeline specification. Pachyderm defines such a variable for each input. The path is defined by the glob pattern in the spec. For example, if you have an input images and a glob pattern of /, Pachyderm defines the images=/pfs/images variable. If you have a glob pattern of /*, Pachyderm matches the files in the images repository and, therefore, the path is images=/pfs/images/liberty.png. input_COMMIT The ID of the commit that is used for the input. For example, images_COMMIT=fa765b5454e3475f902eadebf83eac34. S3_ENDPOINT A Pachyderm S3 gateway sidecar container endpoint. If you have an S3 enabled pipeline, this parameter specifies a URL that you can use to access the pipeline\u0026rsquo;s repositories state when a particular job was run. The URL has the following format: http://\u0026lt;job-ID\u0026gt;-s3:600. An example of accessing the data by using AWS CLI looks like this: `echo foo_data In addition to these environment variables, Kubernetes injects others for Services that run inside the cluster. These variables enable you to connect to those outside services, which can be powerful but might also result in processing being retried multiple times.\nFor example, if your code writes a row to a database, that row might be written multiple times because of retries. Interaction with outside services must be idempotent to prevent unexpected behavior. Furthermore, one of the running services that your code can connect to is Pachyderm itself. This is generally not recommended as very little of the Pachyderm API is idempotent, but in some specific cases it can be a viable approach.\n",

Killing the pods restarts them, which causes them to connect to Jaeger.\nSend Pachyderm a traced request by setting the PACH_TRACE environment variable to \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; before running any pachctl command (note that JAEGER_ENDPOINT must also be set/exported):\nPACH_TRACE=true pachctl list job # for example Pachyderm does not recommend exporting PACH_TRACE because tracing calls can slow them down and make interesting traces hard to find in Jaeger. Therefore, you might want to set this variable for the specific calls you want to trace.\nHowever, Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s client library reads this variable and implements the relevant tracing, so any binary that uses Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s go client library can trace calls if these variables are set.\nView Traces # To view traces, run:\nkubectl port-forward svc/jaeger-query 16686:80 \u0026amp; # UI service Then, connect to localhost:16686 in your browser, and you should see all collected traces.\nℹ️ See Also: Kubernetes Service Environment Variables\nTroubleshooting # If you see \u0026lt;trace-without-root-span\u0026gt;, this likely means that pachd has connected to Jaeger, but pachctl has not.

Promtail runs on each node and sends logs from Kubernetes pods to the Loki API Server, tagging each log entry with information about the pod that produced it.\nYou need to configure Promtail for your environment to ship logs to your Loki instance. If you are running multiple nodes, then you will need to install and configure Promtail for each node shipping logs to Loki.\nFetching logs # While installing Loki will enable the collection of logs, commands such as pachctl logs will not fetch logs directly from Loki until the LOKI_LOGGING environment variable on the pachd container is true.\nThis is controlled by the helm value pachd.lokiLogging, which can be set by adding the following to your values.yaml file:\npachd: lokiLogging: true Pachyderm reads logs from the Loki API Server with a particular set of tags. The URI at which Pachyderm reads from the Loki API Server is determined by the LOKI_SERVICE_HOST and LOKI_SERVICE_PORT environment values automatically added by Loki Kubernetes service.\nIf Loki is deployed after the pachd container, the pachd container will need to be redeployed to receive these connection parameters.\nℹ️ If you are not running Promtail on the node where your Pachyderm pods are located, you will be unable to get logs for pipelines running on that node via pachctl logs -p pipelineName.\nDefault Loki Bundle # Per default, Pachyderm ships with an embedded version of Loki that can be deployed by adding the lokiDeploy: true next to the existing lokiLogging: true.\npachd: lokiDeploy: true lokiLogging: true In such case, add the following section to your value.yaml:\nloki-stack: loki: persistence: enabled: true accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce size: 5Gi storageClassName: standard annotations: {} grafana: enabled: true ℹ️ Grafana Users:\nTo use Grafana, deploy with loki-stack.grafana.enabled: true.\nTo access Grafana, run port-forward with kubectl port-forward svc/pachyderm-grafana 4001:80.

While this is not recommended in any production settings, this option can be useful for a quick setup in development. In that scenario, you do not need any service account or additional GCP Bucket permission (see below).\n# By default the following command spins up a 3-node cluster.

You can check the status on the GCP Console. A kubeconfig entry is automatically generated and set as the current context. As a sanity check, make sure your cluster is up and running by running the following kubectl command:\n# List all pods in the kube-system namespace. kubectl get pods -n kube-system System Response:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE event-exporter-gke-67986489c8-j4jr8 2/2 Running 0 3m21s fluentbit-gke-499hn 2/2 Running 0 3m6s fluentbit-gke-7xp2f 2/2 Running 0 3m6s fluentbit-gke-jx7wt 2/2 Running 0 3m6s gke-metrics-agent-jmqsl 1/1 Running 0 3m6s gke-metrics-agent-rd5pr 1/1 Running 0 3m6s gke-metrics-agent-xxl52 1/1 Running 0 3m6s kube-dns-6c7b8dc9f9-ff4bz 4/4 Running 0 3m16s kube-dns-6c7b8dc9f9-mfjrt 4/4 Running 0 2m27s kube-dns-autoscaler-58cbd4f75c-rl2br 1/1 Running 0 3m16s kube-proxy-gke-nad-cluster-default-pool-2e5710dd-38wz 1/1 Running 0 105s kube-proxy-gke-nad-cluster-default-pool-2e5710dd-4b7j 1/1 Running 0 3m6s kube-proxy-gke-nad-cluster-default-pool-2e5710dd-zmzh 1/1 Running 0 3m5s l7-default-backend-66579f5d7-2q64d 1/1 Running 0 3m21s metrics-server-v0.3.6-6c47ffd7d7-k2hmc 2/2 Running 0 2m38s pdcsi-node-7dtbc 2/2 Running 0 3m6s pdcsi-node-bcbcl 2/2 Running 0 3m6s pdcsi-node-jl8hl 2/2 Running 0 3m6s stackdriver-metadata-agent-cluster-level-85d6d797b4-4l457 2/2 Running 0 2m14s If you don\u0026rsquo;t see something similar to the above output, you can point kubectl to the new cluster manually by running the following command:\n# Update your kubeconfig to point at your newly created cluster. gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} Once your Kubernetes cluster is up, and your infrastructure configured, you are ready to prepare for the installation of Pachyderm. Some of the steps below will require you to keep updating the values.yaml started during the setup of the recommended infrastructure:\n2. Create a GCS Bucket # Create an GCS object store bucket for your data # Pachyderm needs a GCS bucket (Object store) to store your data. You can create the bucket by running the following commands:\nSet up the following system variables:\nBUCKET_NAME — A globally unique GCP bucket name where your data will be stored. GCP_REGION — The GCP region of your Kubernetes cluster e.g. \u0026ldquo;us-west1\u0026rdquo;. Create the bucket:\ngsutil mb -l ${GCP_REGION} gs://${BUCKET_NAME} Check that everything has been set up correctly:\ngsutil ls # You should see the bucket you created. You now need to give Pachyderm access to your GCP resources.\nSet Up Your GCP Service Account # To access your GCP resources, Pachyderm uses a GCP Project Service Account with permissioned access to your desired resources.\nYou can create a Service Account with Google Cloud Console:\nGSA_NAME=\u0026lt;Your Google Service Account Name\u0026gt; gcloud iam service-accounts create ${GSA_NAME} More information about the creation and management of a Service account on GCP documentation.\nConfigure Your Service Account Permissions # For Pachyderm to access your Google Cloud Resources, run the following:\nCreate the following set of variables\nSERVICE_ACCOUNT=\u0026#34;${GSA_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com\u0026#34; # \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; or the namespace in which your cluster was deployed K8S_NAMESPACE=\u0026#34;default\u0026#34; PACH_WI=\u0026#34;serviceAccount:${PROJECT_ID}.svc.id.goog[${K8S_NAMESPACE}/pachyderm]\u0026#34; SIDECAR_WI=\u0026#34;serviceAccount:${PROJECT_ID}.svc.id.goog[${K8S_NAMESPACE}/pachyderm-worker]\u0026#34; CLOUDSQLAUTHPROXY_WI=\u0026#34;serviceAccount:${PROJECT_ID}.svc.id.goog[${K8S_NAMESPACE}/k8s-cloudsql-auth-proxy]\u0026#34; Grant access to cloudSQL and your bucket to the Service Account\n# Grant access to cloudSQL to the Service Account gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \\ --member=\u0026#34;serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}\u0026#34; \\ --role=\u0026#34;roles/cloudsql.client\u0026#34; # Grant access to storage (bucket + volumes) to the Service Account gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \\ --member=\u0026#34;serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}\u0026#34; \\ --role=\u0026#34;roles/storage.admin\u0026#34; Use Workload Identity to run Pachyderm Services as the Service Account\nWorkload Identity is the recommended way to access Google Cloud services from applications running within GKE.\ngcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT} \\ --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \\ --member \u0026#34;${PACH_WI}\u0026#34; gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT} \\ --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \\ --member \u0026#34;${SIDECAR_WI}\u0026#34; gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT} \\ --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \\ --member \u0026#34;${CLOUDSQLAUTHPROXY_WI}\u0026#34; For a set of standard roles, read the GCP IAM permissions documentation.\n3. Persistent Volumes Creation # etcd and PostgreSQL (metadata storage) each claim the creation of a persistent disk.\nIf you plan to deploy Pachyderm with its default bundled PostgreSQL instance, read the warning below, and jump to the deployment section:\n📖 When deploying Pachyderm on GCP, your persistent volumes are automatically created and assigned the default disk size of 50 GBs. Note that StatefulSets is a default as well.\n⚠️ Each persistent disk generally requires a small persistent volume size but high IOPS (1500). If you choose to overwrite the default disk size, depending on your disk choice, you may need to oversize the volume significantly to ensure enough IOPS. For reference, 1GB should work fine for 1000 commits on 1000 files. 10GB is often a sufficient starting size, though we recommend provisioning at least 1500 write IOPS, which requires at least 50GB of space on SSD-based PDs and 1TB of space on Standard PDs.\nIf you plan to deploy a managed PostgreSQL instance (CloudSQL), read the following section. Note that this is the recommended setup in production.\n4. Create a GCP Managed PostgreSQL Database # By default, Pachyderm runs with a bundled version of PostgreSQL. For production environments, it is strongly recommended that you disable the bundled version and use a CloudSQL instance.\nCreate A CloudSQL Instance # 💡 Find the details of the steps and available parameters to create a CloudSQL instance in GCP Documentation: \u0026ldquo;Create instances: CloudSQL for PostgreSQL\u0026rdquo;.\nSet up the following system variable:\nINSTANCE_NAME — Your Cloud SQL instance name. See the illustrative example below:\ngcloud sql instances create ${INSTANCE_NAME} \\ --database-version=POSTGRES_13 \\ --cpu=2 \\ --memory=7680MB \\ --zone=${GCP_ZONE} \\ --availability-type=ZONAL \\ --storage-size=50GB \\ --storage-type=SSD \\ --storage-auto-increase \\ --root-password=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;InstanceRootPassword\u0026gt;\u0026#34; When you create a new Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance, a default admin user Username: \u0026quot;postgres\u0026quot; is created. It will later be used by Pachyderm to access its databases. Note that the --root-password flag above sets the password for this user.\nCheck out Google documentation for more information on how to Create and Manage PostgreSQL Users.\nCreate Your Databases # After your instance is created, you will need to create Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s database(s).\nIf you plan to deploy a standalone cluster (i.e., if you do not plan to register your cluster with a separate enterprise server), you will need to create a second database named \u0026ldquo;dex\u0026rdquo; in your Cloud SQL instance for Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s authentication service. Note that the database must be named dex. This second database is not needed when your cluster is managed by an enterprise server.\nℹ️ Read more about dex on PostgreSQL in Dex\u0026rsquo;s documentation.\nRun the first or both commands depending on your use case.\ngcloud sql databases create pachyderm -i ${INSTANCE_NAME} gcloud sql databases create dex -i ${INSTANCE_NAME} Pachyderm will use the same user \u0026ldquo;postgres\u0026rdquo; to connect to pachyderm as well as to dex.\nUpdate your values.yaml # Once your databases have been created, add the following fields to your Helm values:\nℹ️ To identify a Cloud SQL instance, you can find the INSTANCE_NAME on the Overview page for your instance in the Google Cloud Console, or by running the following command: gcloud sql instances describe INSTANCE_NAME For example: myproject:myregion:myinstance.\nYou will need to retrieve the name of your Cloud SQL connection:\nCLOUDSQL_CONNECTION_NAME=$(gcloud sql instances describe ${INSTANCE_NAME} --format=json | jq .\u0026#34;connectionName\u0026#34;) cloudsqlAuthProxy: enabled: true connectionName: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;CLOUDSQL_CONNECTION_NAME\u0026gt;\u0026#34; serviceAccount: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;SERVICE_ACCOUNT\u0026gt;\u0026#34; resources: requests: memory: \u0026#34;500Mi\u0026#34; cpu: \u0026#34;250m\u0026#34; postgresql: # turns off the install of the bundled postgres. # If not using the built in Postgres, you must specify a Postgresql # database server to connect to in global.postgresql enabled: false global: postgresql: # The postgresql database host to connect to.

Deploy Pachyderm # You have set up your infrastructure, created your GCP bucket and a CloudSQL instance, and granted your cluster access to both: you can now finalize your values.yaml and deploy Pachyderm.\nUpdate Your Values.yaml # See an example of values.yaml here.\nYou might want to create a static IP address to access your cluster externally. Refer to our infrastructure documentation for more details or check the example below:\nSTATIC_IP_NAME=\u0026lt;your address name\u0026gt; gcloud compute addresses create ${STATIC_IP_NAME} --region=${GCP_REGION} STATIC_IP_ADDR=$(gcloud compute addresses describe ${STATIC_IP_NAME} --region=${GCP_REGION} --format=json --flatten=address | jq \u0026#39;.[]\u0026#39; ) ℹ️ If you have not created a Managed CloudSQL instance, replace the Postgresql section below with postgresql:enabled: true in your values.yaml and remove the cloudsqlAuthProxy fields. This setup is not recommended in production environments.\nRetrieve these additional variables, then fill in their values in the YAML file below:\necho $BUCKET_NAME echo $SERVICE_ACCOUNT echo $CLOUDSQL_CONNECTION_NAME deployTarget: GOOGLE proxy: enabled: true service: type: LoadBalancer pachd: enabled: true storage: google: bucket: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;BUCKET_NAME\u0026#34; serviceAccount: additionalAnnotations: iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;SERVICE_ACCOUNT\u0026gt;\u0026#34; name: \u0026#34;pachyderm\u0026#34; worker: serviceAccount: additionalAnnotations: iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;SERVICE_ACCOUNT\u0026gt;\u0026#34; name: \u0026#34;pachyderm-worker\u0026#34; cloudsqlAuthProxy: enabled: true connectionName: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;CLOUDSQL_CONNECTION_NAME\u0026gt;\u0026#34; serviceAccount: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;SERVICE_ACCOUNT\u0026gt;\u0026#34; resources: requests: memory: \u0026#34;500Mi\u0026#34; cpu: \u0026#34;250m\u0026#34; postgresql: enabled: false global: postgresql: postgresqlHost: \u0026#34;cloudsql-auth-proxy.default.svc.cluster.local.\u0026#34; postgresqlPort: \u0026#34;5432\u0026#34; postgresqlSSL: \u0026#34;disable\u0026#34; postgresqlUsername: \u0026#34;postgres\u0026#34; postgresqlPassword: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;InstanceRootPassword\u0026gt;\u0026#34; Deploy Pachyderm on the Kubernetes cluster # You can now deploy a Pachyderm cluster by running this command:\nhelm repo add pach https://helm.pachyderm.com helm repo update helm install pachyderm -f my_values.yaml pach/pachyderm System Response:\nNAME: pachyderm LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Nov 8 16:48:49 2021 NAMESPACE: default STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 ⚠️ If RBAC authorization is a requirement or you run into any RBAC errors see Configure RBAC.\nIt may take a few minutes for the pachd nodes to be running because Pachyderm pulls containers from DockerHub. You can see the cluster status with kubectl, which should output the following when Pachyderm is up and running:\nkubectl get pods Once the pods are up, you should see a pod for pachd running (alongside etcd, pg-bouncer or postgres, console, depending on your installation).\nSystem Response:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE etcd-0 1/1 Running 0 4m50s pachd-5db79fb9dd-b2gdq 1/1 Running 2 4m49s postgres-0 1/1 Running 0 4m50s If you see a few restarts on the pachd pod, you can safely ignore them. That simply means that Kubernetes tried to bring up those containers before other components were ready, so it restarted them.\nFinally, make sure that pachctl talks with your cluster 6.

Note that, unless your deployment is LOCAL (i.e., on a local machine for development only, for example, on Minikube or Docker Desktop), the deployment of Console requires the set up of a DNS, an Ingress, and the activation of authentication.\nInstall # Prerequisites # Install Helm.\nInstall pachctl, the command-line utility for interacting with a Pachyderm cluster.\nChoose the deployment guidelines that apply to you:\nFind the deployment page that applies to your Cloud provider (or custom deployment, or on-premises deployment). It will help list the various installation prerequisites, and deployment instructions (Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Object Store, IdP etc\u0026hellip;) that fit your own use case.\nFor example, if your Cloud provider is Google Cloud Platform, follow the Prerequisites and Deploy Kubernetes sections of the deployment on Google Cloud Platform page.\nAdditionally, those instructions will help identify the configuration parameters needed. Those parameter values will be set in your YAML configuration file as follows.\nEdit a Values.yaml File # Create a personalized my_pachyderm_values.yaml out of this example repository. Pick the example that fits your target deployment and update the relevant values according to the parameters gathered in the previous step.\nRefer to this section to understand Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s main configuration values (License Key, IdP configuration, etc\u0026hellip;) and how you can set them.\nSee the reference values.yaml for the list of all available helm values at your disposal.\n⚠️ No default k8s CPU and memory requests and limits are created for pachd. If you don\u0026rsquo;t provide values in the values.yaml file, then those requests and limits are simply not set.\nFor Production deployments, Pachyderm strongly recommends that you create your values.yaml file with CPU and memory requests and limits for both pachd and etcd set to values appropriate to your specific environment. For reference, 1 CPU and 2 GB memory for each is a sensible default.\nInstall Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s Helm Chart # Get your Helm Repo Info\nhelm repo add pach https://helm.pachyderm.com helm repo update Install Pachyderm\nYou are ready to deploy Pachyderm on the environment of your choice.\nhelm install pachd -f my_pachyderm_values.yaml pach/pachyderm --version \u0026lt;your_chart_version\u0026gt; 📖 To choose a specific helm chart version\nEach chart version is associated with a given version of Pachyderm. You will find the list of all available chart versions and their associated version of Pachyderm on Artifacthub.\nYou can choose a specific helm chart version by adding a --version flag (for example, --version 0.3.0) to your helm install. No additional flag will install the latest GA release of Pachyderm by default. You can choose the latest pre-release version of the chart by using the flag --devel (pre-releases are versions of the chart that correspond to releases of Pachyderm that don\u0026rsquo;t have the GA status yet). For example: When the 2.0 version of Pachyderm was a release candidate, using the flag --devel would let you install the latest RC of 2.0 while no flag would retrieve the newest GA (1.13.4).\nCheck your deployment\nkubectl get pods Once the pods are up, you should see a pod for pachd running (alongside etcd, pg-bouncer or postgres, console, depending on your installation).\nSystem Response:\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE etcd-0 1/1 Running 0 18h pachd-5db79fb9dd-b2gdq 1/1 Running 2 18h postgres-0 1/1 Running 0 18h Have \u0026lsquo;pachctl\u0026rsquo; and your Cluster Communicate # Assuming your pachd is running as shown above, make sure that pachctl can talk to the cluster.\nIf you are exposing your cluster publicly:\nRetrieve the external IP address of your TCP load balancer or your domain name: kubectl get services | grep pachd-lb | awk \u0026#39;{print $4}\u0026#39; Update the context of your cluster with their direct url, using the external IP address/domain name above:\npachctl connect grpc://localhost:80 Check that your are using the right context:\npachctl config get active-context Your cluster context name should show up.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not exposing pachd publicly, you can run:\n# Background this process because it blocks. pachctl port-forward Verify that pachctl and your cluster are connected:\npachctl version System Response:\nCOMPONENT VERSION pachctl 2.5.1 pachd 2.5.1 Uninstall Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s Helm Chart # Helm uninstall a release by running:\nhelm uninstall pachd We recommend making sure that everything is properly removed following a helm uninstall:\nThe uninstall leaves your persistent volumes. To clean them up, run kubectl get pvc and delete the claims data-postgres-0 and etcd-storage-etcd-0. ⚠️ Deleting pvs will result in the loss of your data.\nAll other resources should have been removed by Helm. Run kubectl get all | grep \u0026quot;etcd\\|\\pachd\\|postgres\\|pg-bouncer\u0026quot; to make sure of it and delete any remaining resources where necessary.\nIf your uninstall failed, there might be config jobs still running. Run kubectl get jobs.batch | grep pachyderm and delete any remaining job.\nUpgrade Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s Helm Chart # When a new version of Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s chart is released, or when you want to update some configuration parameters on your cluster, use the helm upgrade command:\nhelm upgrade pachd -f my_new_pachyderm_values.yaml pach/pachyderm --version \u0026lt;your_chart_version\u0026gt; READ BEFORE ANY INSTALL OR UPGRADE: Pachyderm Configuration Values and Platform Secrets # In this section, you will find a complete list of configuration values you can set when installing/upgrading a cluster as well as options to provide them. Refer to your deployment instructions to identify which are needed.\nValues Used By Pachyderm At Installation/Upgrade Time # We have grouped those fields in two categories:\nValues that you will need to provide:\npachd.enterpriseLicenseKey: Your enterprise license (When installing Enterprise) oidc.upstreamIDPs : The list of dex connectors, each containing Oauth client info connecting to an upstream IDP (When setting up the Authentication). If you are not planning to use Enterprise or plug an IdP, then no other value should be needed\nValues autogenerated when left blank. Can be any value:\npachd.rootToken: Password of your root user. pachd.enterpriseSecret: Needed if you connect to an enterprise server. pachd.oauthClientSecret: Pachd oidc config to connect to dex. console.config.oauthClientSecret: Oauth client secret for Console. Required if you set Console Enterprise. global.postgresqlPassword: Password to your postgreSQL. pachd.enterpriseServerToken: Provide this token when installing a cluster that is under an Enterprise Server\u0026rsquo;s umbrella. Those configuration values can be provided to Pachyderm in various ways:\nA - Hard-coded in your values.yaml B - In a secret, by referencing a secret name in your values.yaml A - Provide credentials directly in your values.yaml # You can provide credentials and configuration values directly in your values.yaml or set them with a --set argument during the installation/upgrade. The second table below (Column B) lists the names of the fields in which you can set your values.\nA-1 - Provide the few required values and let Pachyderm generate the rest\nProvide your Enterprise License (For Enterprise users only). Optionally, your IDPs configuration (For Enterprise users using the Authentication feature) The rest of the values will be generated for you.\nℹ️ In the case where you have activated Enterprise and configured your IdP, note that you have the option to set roles at the Cluster level when deploying.\nA-2 - Choose and set your values rather than rely on autogeneration\nFor example, by using:\nFor a root token: openssl rand -hex 16 f438329fc98302779be65eef226d32c1 For other values: openssl rand -base64 42 tJkHm0+8niOtP1F8lAPryO9dGwMV7SL/u/uCZQi24kFuRj+7VYvtj01q ℹ️ Note that those values will be injected into platform secrets at the time of the installation.\nB - Use Secret(s) # If your organization uses tools like ArgoCD for Gitops, you might want to create secrets ahead of time then provide their names in the secretName field of your values.yaml.\nFind the secret name field that references your secret in your values.yaml (Column A) and its corresponding Secret Key (First column) in the second table below.\nPachyderm Platform Secrets # Pachyderm inject the values hard coded in your values.yaml into \u0026ldquo;platform secrets\u0026rdquo; at the time of the deployment or upgrade (those values can be Postgresql admin login username and password, OAuth information to set up your IdP, or your enterprise license key).\nFind the complete list of secrets in the table below:\nSecret Name Key Description pachyderm-auth - root-token - auth-config - cluster-role-bindings - \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo; user password of your cluster. - Pachd oidc config to connect to dex. - Role Based Access declaration at the cluster level.

		"body": "In the simplest case, such as running a Pachyderm cluster locally, implicit and explicit port-forwarding enables you to communicate with pachd, the Pachyderm API pod, and console, the Pachyderm UI. Port-forwarding can be used in cloud environments as well, but a production environment might require you to define additional inbound connection rules.\nBefore we dive into the delivery of external traffic to Pachyderm, read the following recommendations to set up your infrastructure in production.\nℹ️ Refer to our generic \u0026ldquo;Helm Install\u0026rdquo; page for more information on how to install and get started with Helm.\nPachyderm Infrastructure Recommendations # ⚠️ We are now shipping Pachyderm with an embedded proxy allowing your cluster to expose one single port externally. This deployment setup is optional.\nIf you choose to deploy Pachyderm with a Proxy, our new recommended architecture and deployment instructions overwrite the following instructions.\nFor production deployments, we recommend that you:\nUse a secure connection\nMake sure that you have Transport Layer Security (TLS) enabled for Ingress connections. You can deploy pachd and console with different certificates if required. Self-signed certificates might require additional configuration. For instructions on deployment with TLS, see Deploy Pachyderm with TLS.\nUse Pachyderm authentication/authorization\nPachyderm authentication is an additional security layer to protect your data from unauthorized access. See the authentication and authorization section to activate access control and set up an IdP (Identity Provider).\nAdd an Ingress Controller to your cluster for HTTP/HTTPS incoming traffic.\nProvision a TCP load balancer for gRPC incoming traffic. Provision a TCP load balancer with port 30650 (gRPC port) and 30600 (s3gateway port) forwarding to pachd.\nConfigure access to your external IP addresses through firewalls or your Cloud Provider Network Security.\n(Optional) Create a DNS entry for each public IP (each Load Balancer)\nOnce you have your networking infrastructure setup, check the deployment page of your cloud provider. The following section comes back to the setup of an Ingress and a TCP Load Balancer in details.\nDeliver External Traffic To Pachyderm # Pachyderm provides multiple ways to deliver external traffic to services.\nHowever, we recommend to set up the following resources in a production environment:\nAn Ingress Controller to manage HTTP/HTTPS external access to the Console and authentication services (oidc and identity services). A TCP Load Balancer to manage gRPC external access to pachd. The diagram below gives a quick overview of those recommendations on AWS EKS: NodePort # By default, the local deployment of Pachyderm deploys the pachd service as type:NodePort. However, NodePort is a limited solution that is not recommended in production deployments. Therefore, Pachyderm services are otherwise exposed on the cluster internal IP (ClusterIP) instead of each node’s IP (Nodeport).\nIngress # An Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services in the cluster such as Console or Authentication services.\nTo configure the Ingress, enable the ingress field in your values.yaml, and chose one of the following:\ndeploy your preferred Ingress Controller (Traefik, NGINX). or, provide any specific Kubernetes Ingress annotations to customize your ingress controller behavior. If your ingress is enabled:\nCloud providers may provision a Load balancer automatically. For example, AWS will provision an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of Console. The deployment of Pachyderm (Check our Helm documentation) automatically creates the following set of rules: - host: \u0026lt;your_domain_name\u0026gt; http: paths: - path: \u0026#34;/dex\u0026#34; backend: serviceName: \u0026#34;pachd\u0026#34; servicePort: \u0026#34;identity-port\u0026#34; - path: \u0026#34;/authorization-code/callback\u0026#34; backend: serviceName: \u0026#34;pachd\u0026#34; servicePort: \u0026#34;oidc-port\u0026#34; - path: \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34; backend: serviceName: \u0026#34;console\u0026#34; servicePort: \u0026#34;console-http\u0026#34; See our reference values.yaml for all available fields.\n📖 You might choose to deploy your preferred Ingress Controller (Traefik, NGINX). Read about the installation and configuration of Traefik on a cluster.\n⚠️ To have the ingress routes use the https protocol without enabling the cert secret configuration, set ingress.uriHttpsProtoOverride to true in your values.yaml.\nExample on AWS EKS # In the example below, we are opening the HTTPS port and enabling TLS.\ningress: enabled: true annotations: alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: arn:aws:acm:region:account-id:certificate/aaaa-bbbb-cccc alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: pachyderm # lets multiple ingress resources be configured into one load balancer alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: \u0026#39;[{\u0026#34;HTTPS\u0026#34;: 443}]\u0026#39; alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internal alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/security-groups: sg-aaaa alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/subnets: subnet-aaaa, subnet-bbbb, subnet-cccc alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb host: \u0026#34;your_domain_name\u0026#34; tls: enabled: true secretName: \u0026#34;pach-tls\u0026#34; Example on GCP GKE # In the example below using the ingress controller Traefik, we are opening the HTTPS port and enabling TLS.\ningress: enabled: true annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.clas: traefik host: \u0026#34;your_domain_name\u0026#34; tls: enabled: true secretName: \u0026#34;pach-tls\u0026#34; Example on Azure AKS # In the example below, we are using the ingress controller Nginx, and opening the HTTP port.\ningress: enabled: true annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \u0026#34;nginx\u0026#34; host: \u0026#34;your_domain_name\u0026#34; tls: enabled: true secretName: \u0026#34;pach-tls\u0026#34; ATTENTION: You must use TLS when deploying on Azure.\nAs of today, few Ingress Controller offer full support of the gRPC protocol. To access pachd over gRPC (for example, when using pachctl or the s3Gateway, we recommend using a Load Balancer instead.\n📖 See Also:\nKubernetes Ingress. Kubernetes Ingress Controller. LoadBalancer # You should load balance all gRPC and S3 incoming traffic to a TCP LB (load balanced at L4 of the OSI model) deployed in front of the pachd service. To automatically provision an external load balancer in your current cloud (if supported), enable the externalService field of the pachd service in your values.yaml as follow:\n# If enabled, External service creates a service which is safe to # be exposed externally pachd: externalService: enabled: true apiGRPCPort: 30650 s3GatewayPort: 30600 annotations: {see example below} See our reference values.yaml for all available fields.\nℹ️ When externalService is enabled, Pachyderm creates a corresponding pachd-lb service of type:LoadBalancer allowing your cloud platform (AWS, GKE\u0026hellip;) to provision a TCP Load Balancer automatically.\nAdd the appropriate annotations to attach any Load Balancer configuration information to the metadata of your service.\nExample on AWS EKS # In the following example, we deploy an NLB and enable TLS on AWS EKS:\npachd: externalService: enabled: true apiGRPCPort: 30650 s3GatewayPort: 30600 annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: \u0026#34;external\u0026#34; service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: \u0026#34;ip\u0026#34; service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: \u0026#34;internal\u0026#34; service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-subnets: \u0026#34;subnet-aaaaa,subnet-bbbbb,subnet-ccccc\u0026#34; service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: \u0026#34;arn:aws:acm:region:account-id:certificate/aaa-bbb-cccc\u0026#34; service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports: \u0026#34;30600,30650,30657,30658\u0026#34; Example on GCP GKE # In the following example, we pre created a static IP by running gcloud compute addresses create ADDRESS_NAME --global --ip-version IPV4, then passed this external IP to the values.yaml as follow:\npachd: externalService: enabled: true apiGRPCPort: 30650 s3GatewayPort: 30600 loadBalancerIP: ${ADDRESS_NAME} Example on Azure AKS # This example is identical to the example on Google GKE.\npachd: externalService: enabled: true apiGRPCPort: 30650 s3GatewayPort: 30600 loadBalancerIP: ${ADDRESS_NAME} Next: Find the deployment page that matches your cloud provider\n",

You will find instructions on how to set up an ingress controller, a load balancer, or connect an Identity Provider for access control. If you are planning to install Pachyderm UI. Read our Console deployment instructions. Note that, unless your deployment is LOCAL (i.e., on a local machine for development only, for example, on Minikube or Docker Desktop), the deployment of Console requires, at a minimum, the set up of an Ingress. Troubleshooting a deployment? Check out Troubleshooting Deployments. 💡 We are now shipping Pachyderm with an optional embedded proxy allowing your cluster to expose one single port externally. This deployment setup is optional.\nIf you choose to deploy Pachyderm with a Proxy, check out our new recommended architecture and deployment instructions.\nIntroduction # Deploying Pachyderm successfully on-premises requires a few prerequisites. Pachyderm is built on Kubernetes. Before you can deploy Pachyderm, you will need to perform the following actions:\nDeploy Kubernetes on-premises. Deploy two Kubernetes persistent volumes that Pachyderm will use to store its metadata. Deploy an on-premises object store using a storage provider like MinIO, EMC\u0026rsquo;s ECS, or SwiftStack to provide S3-compatible access to your data storage. Finally, Deploy Pachyderm using Helm by running the helm install command with the appropriate values configured in your values.yaml. We recommend reading these generic deployment steps if you are unfamiliar with Helm. Prerequisites # Before you start, you will need the following clients installed:\nkubectl pachctl Setting Up To Deploy On-Premises # Deploying Kubernetes # The Kubernetes docs have instructions for deploying Kubernetes in a variety of on-premise scenarios. We recommend following one of these guides to get Kubernetes running.\n💡 Pachyderm recommends running your cluster on Kubernetes 1.19.0 and above.\nStorage Classes # Once you deploy Kubernetes, you will also need to configure storage classes to consume persistent volumes for etcd and postgresql.\n⚠️ The database and metadata service (Persistent disks) generally requires a small persistent volume size (i.e. 10GB) but high IOPS (1500), therefore, depending on your storage provider, you may need to oversize the volume significantly to ensure enough IOPS.\nOnce you have determined the name of the storage classes you are going to use and the sizes, you can add them to your helm values file, specifically:\netcd: storageClass: MyStorageClass size: 10Gi postgresql: persistence: storageClass: MyStorageClass size: 10Gi Deploying An Object Store # An object store is used by Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s pachd for storing all your data. The object store you use must be accessible via a low-latency, high-bandwidth connection.\nℹ️ For an on-premises deployment, it is not advisable to use a cloud-based storage mechanism. Do not deploy an on-premises Pachyderm cluster against cloud-based object stores (such as S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage).\nYou will, however, access your Object Store using the S3 protocol.\nStorage providers like MinIO (the most common and officially supported option), EMC\u0026rsquo;s ECS, Ceph, or SwiftStack provide S3-compatible access to enterprise storage for on-premises deployment.\nSizing And Configuring The Object Store # Start with a large multiple of your current data set size.\nYou will need four items to configure the object store. We are prefixing each item with how we will refer to it in the helm values file.\nendpoint: The access endpoint. For example, MinIO\u0026rsquo;s endpoints are usually something like minio-server:9000.\nDo not begin it with the protocol; it is an endpoint, not an url. Also, check if your object store (e.g. MinIO) is using SSL/TLS. If not, disable it using secure: false.\nbucket: The bucket name you are dedicating to Pachyderm. Pachyderm will need exclusive access to this bucket.\nid: The access key id for the object store.\nsecret: The secret key for the object store.\npachd: storage: backend: minio minio: bucket: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; id: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; secure: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Next Step: Proceed to your Helm installation # Once you have Kubernetes deployed, your storage classes setup, and your object store configured, follow those steps to Helm install Pachyderm on your cluster.\n",

In addition we recommend using a managed database instance (such as RDS for AWS).\n⚠️ Interested in deploying with an embedded proxy and expose one single external port?\nWe are now shipping Pachyderm with an optional embedded proxy allowing your cluster to expose one single port externally. This deployment setup is optional.\nIf you choose to deploy Pachyderm with a Proxy, check out our new recommended architecture and deployment instructions.\nDeploying with a proxy presents a couple of advantages:\nYou only need to set up one TCP Load Balancer (No more Ingress in front of Console). You will need one DNS only. It simplifies the deployment of Console. No more port-forward. Once you have your networking infrastructure set up, apply a helm values file such as the one specified in the example file below to wire up routing through an Ingress, and set up TLS. We recommend using a certificate manager such as cert-manager to refresh certificates and inject them as kubernetes secrets into your cluster for the ingress and load balancer to use.\nℹ️ This example uses Traefik as an Ingress controller. To configure other ingress controllers, apply their annotations in .Values.console.annotations.\nvalues.yaml with enterprise license \u0026amp; authentication # ingress: enabled: true host: \u0026lt;DNS-ENTRY\u0026gt; tls: enabled: true secretName: \u0026#34;pach-tls\u0026#34; pachd: tls: enabled: true secretName: \u0026#34;pach-tls\u0026#34; externalService: enabled: true loadBalancerIP: \u0026lt;LOAD-BALANCER-IP\u0026gt; console: enabled: true annotations: ## annotations specific to integrate with your ingress-controller ## the example below is a provided configuration specific to traefik as an ingress-controller traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.tls: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \u0026#34;traefik\u0026#34; ",

		"body": "On this page, you will find simplified deployment instructions and Helm values to get you started with the latest release of Pachyderm on the Kubernetes Engine of your choice (AWS (EKS), Google (GKS), and Azure (AKS)).\nFor each cloud provider, we will give you the option to \u0026ldquo;quick deploy\u0026rdquo; Pachyderm with or without an enterprise key. A quick deployment allows you to experiment with Pachyderm without having to go through any infrastructure setup. In particular, you do not need to set up any object store or PostgreSQL instance.\n💡 The deployment steps highlighted in this document are not intended for production. For production settings, please read our infrastructure recommendations. In particular, we recommend:\nthe use of a managed PostgreSQL server (RDS, CloudSQL, or PostgreSQL Server) rather than Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s default bundled PostgreSQL. the setup of a TCP Load Balancer in front of your pachd service. the setup of an Ingress Controller in front of Console. Then find your targeted Cloud provider in the Deploy and Manage section of this documentation.\n⚠️ We are now shipping Pachyderm with an optional embedded proxy allowing your cluster to expose one single port externally. This deployment setup is optional.\nIf you choose to deploy Pachyderm with a Proxy, check out our new recommended architecture and deployment instructions.\nDeploying with a proxy presents a couple of advantages:\nYou only need to set up one TCP Load Balancer (No more Ingress in front of Console). You will need one DNS only. It simplifies the deployment of Console. No more port-forward. 1. Prerequisites # Pachyderm is deployed on a Kubernetes Cluster.\nInstall the following clients on your machine before you start creating your cluster. Use the latest available version of the components listed below.\nkubectl: the cli to interact with your cluster. pachctl: the cli to interact with Pachyderm. Install Helm for your deployment. ⚠️ Get a Enterprise key\nTo get a free-trial token, fill in this form, get in touch with us at sales@pachyderm.io, or on our Slack.\nSelect your favorite cloud provider.\n💡 Note that we often use the acronym CE for Community Edition.\n2.

Prerequisites # Note that the following steps start right after installing your EKS cluster. For informations on how to set your cluster up in production, refer to the deploy Kubernetes section of our deployment instructions on AWS.\n2. Install The AWS Secrets and Configuration Provider (ASCP) # To retrieve your secrets through your workloads running on your cluster, you will first need to install:\nA Secrets Store CSI driver AWS Secrets Manager and Config Provider ⚠️ The ASCP works with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) 1.17+.\nInstall the Secrets Store CSI Driver # Deploy the Secrets Store CSI driver by following the installation steps.\n💡 Make sure to enable the Sync as Kubernetes Secret feature explicitly by setting the helm parameter syncSecret.enabled to true.\nℹ️ helm repo add secrets-store-csi-driver https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/secrets-store-csi-driver/charts helm install csi-secrets-store secrets-store-csi-driver/secrets-store-csi-driver --namespace kube-system --set syncSecret.enabled=true Install the AWS Provider # AWS provider for the Secrets Store CSI Driver allows you to make secrets stored in Secrets Manager appear as files mounted in Kubernetes pods.\nℹ️ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-aws/main/deployment/aws-provider-installer.yaml 3. Store Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s Secrets in Secrets Manager # In your Secret Manager Console, click on Store a new secret, select the Other type of Secret (for generic secrets), provide the following Key/Value pairs, then choose a secret name.\nSecret Key Description Value root_token Root clusterAdmin of your cluster Any postgresql_password Password to your database Any OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET Oauth client secret for Console Required if you set an Enterprise key Any enterprise_license_key Your enterprise license Your enterprise License key pachd_oauth_client_secret Oauth client secret for pachd Any enterprise_secret Needed if you connect to an enterprise server Any Create your secret, then retrieve its arn. It will be needed in the next phase.\n4- Grant Your EKS Cluster Access To Your Secrets Manager # Your cluster has an OpenID Connect issuer URL associated with it. To use IAM roles for service accounts, an IAM OIDC provider must exist for your cluster.\nCreate an IAM OIDC Provider # Before granting your EKS pods the proper permissions to access your secrets, you need to create an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster or retrieve the arn of your provider if you already have one created.\nFollow the steps in AWS user guide\nExample # eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;cluster-name\u0026gt;\u0026#34; Create An IAM Policy That Grants Read Access To Your Secret # Create a new Policy from your IAM Console Select the JSON tab.

		"body": "This page will walk you through the main steps required to manually back up and restore the state of a Pachyderm cluster in production.\nDetails on how to perform those steps might vary depending on your infrastructure and cloud provider / on-premises setup.\nRefer to your provider\u0026rsquo;s documentation.\nOverview # Pachyderm state is stored in two main places (See our high-level architecture diagram):\nan object-store holding Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s data. a PostgreSQL instance made up of one or two databases: pachyderm holding Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s metadata and dex holding authentication data. Backing up a Pachyderm cluster involves snapshotting both the object store and the PostgreSQL database(s) (see above), in a consistent state, at a given point in time.\nRestoring it involves re-populating the database(s) and the object store using those backups, then recreating a Pachyderm cluster.\nℹ️ Make sure that you have a bucket for backup use, separate from the object store used by your cluster. Depending on the reasons behind your cluster recovery, you might choose to use an existing vs. a new instance of PostgreSQL and/or the object store. Manual Back Up Of A Pachyderm Cluster # Before any manual backup:\nMake sure to retain a copy of the Helm values used to deploy your cluster. Then, suspend any state-mutating operations. ℹ️ Backups incur downtime until operations are resumed. Operational best practices include notifying Pachyderm users of the outage and providing an estimated time when downtime will cease. Downtime duration is a function of the size of the data be to backed up and the networks involved; Testing before going into production and monitoring backup times on an ongoing basis might help make accurate predictions. Suspend Operations # Pause any external automated process ingressing data to Pachyderm input repos, or queue/divert those as they will fail to connect to the cluster while the backup occurs.\nSuspend all mutation of state by scaling pachd and the worker pods down:\n⚠️ Before starting, make sure that your context points to the server you want to pause by running pachctl config get active-context. Find more information on how to set your context in our deployment section.\nTo pause Pachyderm:\nIf you are an Enterprise user: Run the pachctl enterprise pause command.\nAlternatively, you can use kubectl:\nBefore starting, make sure that kubectl points to the right cluster. Run kubectl config get-contexts to list all available clusters and contexts (the current context is marked with a *), then kubectl config use-context \u0026lt;your-context-name\u0026gt; to set the proper active context.\nkubectl scale deployment pachd --replicas 0 kubectl scale rc --replicas 0 -l suite=pachyderm,component=worker Note that it takes some time for scaling down to take effect;\nRun the watch command to monitor the state of pachd and worker pods terminating:\nwatch -n 5 kubectl get pods Back Up The Databases And The Object Store # This step is specific to your database and object store hosting.\nIf your PostgreSQL instance is solely dedicated to Pachyderm, you can use PostgreSQL\u0026rsquo;s tools, like pg_dumpall, to dump your entire PostgreSQL state.\nAlternatively, you can use targeted pg_dump commands to dump the pachyderm and dex databases, or use your Cloud Provider\u0026rsquo;s backup product.\nIn any case, make sure to use TLS. Note that if you are using a cloud provider, you might choose to use the provider’s method of making PostgreSQL backups.\n⚠️ A production setting of Pachyderm implies that you are running a managed PostgreSQL instance.\n📖 PostgreSQL on AWS RDS backup GCP Cloud SQL backup Azure Database for PostgreSQL backup For on-premises Kubernetes deployments, check the vendor documentation for your on-premises PostgreSQL for details on backing up and restoring your databases.\nTo back up the object store, you can either download all objects or use the object store provider’s backup method.\nThe latter is preferable since it will typically not incur egress costs. 📖 AWS backup for S3 GCP Cloud storage bucket backup Azure blob backup For on-premises Kubernetes deployments, check the vendor documentation for your on-premises object store for details on backing up and restoring a bucket.\nResuming operations # Once your backup is completed, resume your normal operations by scaling pachd back up. It will take care of restoring the worker pods:\nEnterprise users: run pachctl enterprise unpause.\nAlternatively, if you used kubectl:\nkubectl scale deployment pachd --replicas 1 Restore Pachyderm # There are two primary use cases for restoring a cluster:\nYour data have been corrupted, preventing your cluster from functioning correctly. You want the same version of Pachyderm re-installed on the latest uncorrupted data set. You have upgraded a cluster and are encountering problems. You decide to uninstall the current version and restore the latest backup of a previous version of Pachyderm. Depending on your scenario, pick all or a subset of the following steps:\nPopulate new pachyderm and dex (if required) databases on your PostgreSQL instance Populate a new bucket or use the backed-up object-store (note that, in that case, it will no longer be a backup) Create a new empty Kubernetes cluster and give it access to your databases and bucket Deploy Pachyderm into your new cluster 📖 Find the detailed installations instructions of your PostgreSQL instance, bucket, Kubernetes cluster, permissions setup, and Pachyderm deployment for each Cloud Provider in the Deploy section of our Documentation\nRestore The Databases And Objects # Restore PostgreSQL backups into your new databases using the appropriate method (this is most straightforward when using a cloud provider). Copy the objects from the backed-up object store to your new bucket or re-use your backup. Deploy Pachyderm Into The New Cluster # Finally, update the copy of your original Helm values to point Pachyderm to the new databases and the new object store, then use Helm to install Pachyderm into the new cluster.\n📖 The values needing an update and deployment instructions are detailed in the Chapter 6 of all our cloud installation pages. For example, in the case of GCP, check the deploy Pachyderm chapter\nConnect \u0026lsquo;pachctl\u0026rsquo; To Your Restored Cluster # \u0026hellip;and check that your cluster is up and running.\nBackup/Restore A Stand-Alone Enterprise Server # Backing up / restoring an Enterprise Server is similar to the back up / restore of a regular cluster (see above), with two slight variations:\nThe name of its Kubernetes deployment is pach-enterprise versus pachd in the case of a regular cluster. The Enterprise Server does not use an Object Store. An Enterprise server only requires a dex database. Backup A Standalone Enterprise Server # ⚠️ Make sure that pachctl and kubectl are pointing to the right cluster. Check your Enterprise Server context: pachctl config get active-enterprise-context, or pachctl config set active-enterprise-context \u0026lt;my-enterprise-context-name\u0026gt; --overwrite to set it.\nPause the Enterprise Server like you would pause a regular cluster by running pachctl enterprise pause (Enterprise users), or using kubectl. ℹ️ kubectl users: There is a difference with the pause of a regular cluster. The deployment of the enterprise server is named pach-enterprise; therefore, the first command should be:\nkubectl scale deployment pach-enterprise --replicas 0 There is no need to pause all the Pachyderm clusters registered to the Enterprise Server to backup the enterprise server; however, pausing the Enterprise server will result in your clusters becoming unavailable.\nAs a reminder, the Enterprise Server does not use any object-store. Therefore, the backup of the Enterprise Server only consists in backing up the database dex.\nResume the operations on your Enterprise Server by running pachctl enterprise unpause (Enterprise users) to scale the pach-enterprise deployment back up. Alternatively, if you used kubectl, run:\nkubectl scale deployment pach-enterprise --replicas 1 Restore An Enterprise Server # Follow the steps above while skipping all tasks related to creating and populating a new object-store.\nOnce your cluster is up and running, check that all your clusters are automatically registered with your new Enterprise Server.\nAdditional Info # For additional questions about backup / restore, you can post them in the community #help channel on Slack, or reach out to your TAM if you are an Enterprise customer.\n",

Otherwise, read the following section. Set up a GPU enabled Kubernetes Cluster # Pachyderm leverages Kubernetes Device Plugins to let Kubernetes Pods access specialized hardware such as GPUs. For instructions on how to set up a GPU-enabled Kubernetes cluster through device plugins, see the Kubernetes documentation.\nPachyderm on NVIDIA DGX A100 # Let’s walk through the main steps allowing Pachyderm to leverage the AI performance of your DGX A100 GPUs.\n📖 Read about NVIDIA DGX A100\u0026rsquo;s full userguide.\n💡 Support for scheduling GPU workloads in Kubernetes requires a fair amount of trial and effort. To ease the process:\nThis setup page will walk you through very detailed installation steps to prepare your Kubernetes cluster. Take advantage of a user\u0026rsquo;s past experience in this blog. Here is a quick recap of what will be needed:\nHave a working Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes attached to your cluster. Install the DGX system in a hosting environment. Add the DGX to your K8s API server as a worker node. Now that the DGX is added to your API server, you can then proceed to:\nEnable the GPU worker node in the Kubernetes cluster by installing NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s dependencies:\nDependencies packages and deployment methods may vary. The following list is not exhaustive and is intended to serve as a general guideline.\nNVIDIA drivers\nFor complete instructions on setting up NVIDIA drivers, visit this quickstart guide or check this summary of the steps.\nNVIDIA Container Toolkit (nvidia-docker2)\nYou may need to use different packages depending on your container engine.\nNVIDIA Kubernetes Device Plugin\nTo use GPUs in Kubernetes, the NVIDIA Device Plugin is required. The NVIDIA Device Plugin is a daemonset that enumerates the number of GPUs on each node of the cluster and allows pods to be run on GPUs. Follow those steps to deploy the device plugin as a daemonset using helm.\nCheckpoint: Run NVIDIA System Management Interface (nvidia-smi) on the CLI. It should return the list of NVIDIA GPUs.\nTest a sample container with GPU:\nTo test whether CUDA jobs can be deployed, run a sample CUDA (vectorAdd) application.\nFor reference, find the pod spec below:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: gpu-test spec: restartPolicy: OnFailure containers: - name: cuda-vector-add image: \u0026#34;nvidia/samples:vectoradd-cuda10.2\u0026#34; resources: limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 Save it as gpu-pod.yaml then deploy the application:\nkubectl apply -f gpu-pod.yaml Check the logs to make sure that the app completed successfully:\nkubectl get pods gpu-test If the container above is scheduled successfully: install Pachyderm. You are ready to start leveraging NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s GPUs in your Pachyderm pipelines.\n💡 Note that you have the option to use GPUs for compute-intensive workloads on:\nGoogle Container Engine (GKE). Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Azure Kubermnetes Service (AKS). Configure GPUs in Pipelines # Once your GPU-enabled Kubernetes cluster is set, you can request a GPU tier in your pipeline specifications by setting up GPU resource limits, along with its type and number of GPUs.\n💡 By default, Pachyderm workers are spun up and wait for new input. That works great for pipelines that are processing a lot of new incoming commits. However, for lower volume of input commits, you could have your pipeline workers \u0026rsquo;taking\u0026rsquo; the GPU resource as far as k8s is concerned, but \u0026lsquo;idling\u0026rsquo; as far as you are concerned.\nMake sure to set the autoscaling field to true so that if your pipeline is not getting used, the worker pods get spun down and the GPU resource freed. Additionally, specify how much of GPU your pipeline worker will need via the resource_requests fields in your pipeline specification with resource_requests \u0026lt;= resource_limits.

Users can configure PachW\u0026rsquo;s min and max replicas as well as define nodeSelectors, tolerations, and resource requests. Using PachW allows power users to save on costs by claiming fewer resources and running storage tasks on less expensive nodes.\n⚠️ If you are upgrading to 2.5.0+ for the first time and you wish to use PachW, you must calculate how many maxReplicas you need. By default, PachW is set to maxReplicas:1 \u0026mdash; however, that is not sufficient for production runs.\nmaxReplicas # You should set the maxReplicas value to at least match the number of pipeline replicas that you have. For high performance, we suggest taking the following approach:\nnumber of pipelines * highest parallelism spec * 1.5 = maxReplicas\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you have 6 pipelines. One of these pipelines has a parallelism spec value of 6, and the rest are 5 or fewer.\n6 * 6 * 1.5 = 54\nminReplicas # Workloads that constantly process storage and compaction tasks because they are committing rapidly may want to increase minReplicas to have instances on standby.\nnodeSelectors # Workloads that utilize GPUs and other expensive resources may want to add a node selector to scope PachW instances to less expensive nodes.\nValues # Options: Enabled With Minimum With Specific Resources As Sidecars (Legacy) pachw: inheritFromPachd: true # defaults below configuration options like \u0026#39;resources\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;tolerations\u0026#39; to values from pachd maxReplicas: 1 minReplicas: 0 inSidecars: false #tolerations: [] #affinity: {} #nodeSelector: {} pachw: inheritFromPachd: true # defaults below configuration options like \u0026#39;resources\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;tolerations\u0026#39; to values from pachd maxReplicas: 6 # set to match the number of pipeline replicas you have; sample formula: pipeline count * parallelism = target maxReplicas minReplicas: 1 #tolerations: [] #affinity: {} #nodeSelector: {} #resources: # sets kubernetes resource configuration for pachw pods.

It implements most of the functionalities provided with the pachctl CLI tool allowing you to easily integrate operations like create repo, put a file, or create pipeline into your python applications.\nℹ️ Use python-pachyderm v7.3 with Pachyderm 2.5.x.\nYou will find all you need to get you started or dive into the details of the available modules and functions in the API documentation, namely:\nThe installation instructions and links to PyPI. A quick \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; example to jumpstart your understanding of the API. Links to python-pachyderm main Github repository with a list of useful examples. As well as the entire reference API. Node Client # Our Javascript client node-pachyderm is a library officially supported by Pachyderm and used in production by Pachyderm Console.\nToday, we provide only read operations as shown in Console. Over time, we will add additional functionality to the SDK. However, there are no near-term plans to reach parity with python-pachyderm yet.\nPlease get in touch with us if you are interested in contributing or ask your questions on our dedicated slack channel.\nYou will find installations instructions and a first quick overview of how to use the library in our public repository. Check also our opencv example.\nOther languages # Pachyderm uses a simple protocol buffer API. Protobufs support other languages, any of which can be used to programmatically use Pachyderm.

Specifying a time enables you to run on matching times from the past or skip times from the present and only start running on matching times in the future. Format the time value according to RFC3339. overwrite An optional field that defines whether you want the timestamp file to be overwritten on each tick; defaults to simply writing new files on each tick. By default, when \u0026quot;overwrite\u0026quot; is disabled, ticks accumulate in the cron input repo. When \u0026quot;overwrite\u0026quot; is enabled, Pachyderm erases the old ticks and adds new ticks with each commit. If you do not add any manual ticks or run pachctl run cron, only one tick file per commit (for the latest tick) is added to the input repo. Behavior # The input field in a Pachyderm Pipeline Spec is used to specify the inputs to the pipeline, which are the Pachyderm repositories that the pipeline should read data from. The input field can include both static and dynamic inputs.\nThe cron field within the input field is used to specify a dynamic input that is based on a cron schedule. This is useful for pipelines that need to process data on a regular schedule, such as daily or hourly.\nA repo is created for each cron input. When a Cron input triggers, pachd commits a single file, named by the current RFC3339 timestamp to the repo which contains the time which satisfied the spec.\nWhen to Use # You should use a cron input in a Pachyderm Pipeline Spec when you need to process data on a regular schedule, such as hourly or daily. A cron input allows you to specify a schedule for the pipeline to run, and Pachyderm will automatically trigger the pipeline at the specified times.\nExample scenarios:\nBatch processing: If you have a large volume of data that needs to be processed on a regular schedule, a cron input can be used to trigger the processing automatically, without the need for manual intervention.\nData aggregation: If you need to collect data from different sources and process it on a regular schedule, a cron input can be used to automate the data collection and processing.\nReport generation: If you need to generate reports on a regular schedule, a cron input can be used to trigger the report generation process automatically.\n",

The resulting groups are then passed to your pipeline as a series of grouped datums, where each datum is a single group of files.\nYou can specify multiple group input fields in a Pachyderm Pipeline Spec, each with their own group_by parameter. This allows you to group files by multiple fields or patterns, and pass each group to your pipeline as a separate datum.\nThe glob and group_by parameters must be configured.\nWhen to Use # You should consider using the group input in a Pachyderm Pipeline Spec when you have large datasets with multiple files that you want to partition or group by a specific field or pattern. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as when you need to perform complex data analysis on a large dataset, or when you need to group files by some attribute or characteristic in order to facilitate further processing.\nExample scenarios:\nPartitioning data by time: If you have a large dataset that spans a long period of time, you might want to partition it by day, week, or month in order to perform time-based analysis or modeling. In this case, you could use the group input field to group files by date or time, and then process each group separately.\nGrouping data by user or account: If you have a dataset that includes data from multiple users or accounts, you might want to group the data by user or account in order to perform user-based analysis or modeling. In this case, you could use the group input field to group files by user or account, and then process each group separately.\nPartitioning data by geography: If you have a dataset that includes data from multiple geographic regions, you might want to partition it by region in order to perform location-based analysis or modeling. In this case, you could use the group input field to group files by region, and then process each group separately.\n",

To mitigate datums failing for transient connection reasons, Pachyderm automatically retries user code three (3) times before marking a datum as failed. Additionally, you can set the datum_tries field to determine the number of times a job attempts to run on a datum when a failure occurs.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s compare \u0026quot;until_success\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;every_job\u0026quot;:\nSay we have 2 identical pipelines (reprocess_until_success.json and reprocess_at_every_job.json) but for the \u0026quot;reprocess_spec\u0026quot; field set to \u0026quot;every_job\u0026quot; in reprocess_at_every_job.json.\nBoth use the same input repo and have a glob pattern set to /*.\nWhen adding 3 text files to the input repo (file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt), the 2 pipelines (reprocess_until_success and reprocess_at_every_job) will process the 3 datums (here, the glob pattern /* creates one datum per file). Now, let\u0026rsquo;s add a 4th file file4.txt to our input repo or modify the content of file2.txt for example. Case of our default reprocess_until_success.json pipeline: A quick check at the list datum on the job id shows 4 datums, of which 3 were skipped. (Only the changed file was processed) Case of reprocess_at_every_job.json: A quick check at the list datum on the job id shows that all 4 datums were reprocessed, none were skipped. ⚠️ \u0026quot;reprocess_spec\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;every_job will not take advantage of Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s default de-duplication. In effect, this can lead to slower pipeline performance. Before using this setting, consider other options such as including metadata in your file, naming your files with a timestamp, UUID, or other unique identifiers in order to take advantage of de-duplication. Review how datum processing works to understand more.\nWhen to Use # Per default, Pachyderm avoids repeated processing of unchanged datums (i.e., it processes only the datums that have changed and skip the unchanged datums). This incremental behavior ensures efficient resource utilization. However, you might need to alter this behavior for specific use cases and force the reprocessing of all of your datums systematically. This is especially useful when your pipeline makes an external call to other resources, such as a deployment or triggering an external pipeline system. Set \u0026quot;reprocess_spec\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;every_job\u0026quot; in order to enable this behavior.\n",

Knowing this in advance enables Pachyderm to schedule big jobs on separate machines, so that they do not conflict, slow down, or terminate.\nThis parameter is optional, and if you do not explicitly add it in the pipeline spec, Pachyderm creates Kubernetes containers with the following default resources:\nThe user and storage containers request 0 CPU, 0 disk space, and 64MB of memory. The init container requests the same amount of CPU, memory, and disk space that is set for the user container. The resource_requests parameter enables you to overwrite these default values.\nThe memory field is a string that describes the amount of memory, in bytes, that each worker needs. Allowed SI suffixes include M, K, G, Mi, Ki, Gi, and other.\nFor example, a worker that needs to read a 1GB file into memory might set \u0026quot;memory\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1.2G\u0026quot; with a little extra for the code to use in addition to the file. Workers for this pipeline will be placed on machines with at least 1.2GB of free memory, and other large workers will be prevented from using it, if they also set their resource_requests.\nThe cpu field is a number that describes the amount of CPU time in cpu seconds/real seconds that each worker needs. Setting \u0026quot;cpu\u0026quot;: 0.5 indicates that the worker should get 500ms of CPU time per second. Setting \u0026quot;cpu\u0026quot;: 2 indicates that the worker gets 2000ms of CPU time per second. In other words, it is using 2 CPUs, though worker threads might spend 500ms on four physical CPUs instead of one second on two physical CPUs.\nThe disk field is a string that describes the amount of ephemeral disk space, in bytes, that each worker needs. Allowed SI suffixes include M, K, G, Mi, Ki, Gi, and other.\nIn both cases, the resource requests are not upper bounds. If the worker uses more memory than it is requested, it does not mean that it will be shut down. However, if the whole node runs out of memory, Kubernetes starts deleting pods that have been placed on it and exceeded their memory request, to reclaim memory. To prevent deletion of your worker node, you must set your memory request to a sufficiently large value. However, if the total memory requested by all workers in the system is too large, Kubernetes cannot schedule new workers because no machine has enough unclaimed memory. cpu works similarly, but for CPU time.\nFor more information about resource requests and limits see the Kubernetes docs on the subject.\n",

Behavior # cmd is not run inside a shell which means that wildcard globbing (*), pipes (|), and file redirects (\u0026gt; and \u0026gt;\u0026gt;) do not work. To specify these settings, you can set cmd to be a shell of your choice, such as sh and pass a shell script to stdin. err_cmd can be used to ignore failed datums while still writing successful datums to the output repo, instead of failing the whole job when some datums fail. The transform.err_cmd command has the same limitations as transform.cmd. stdin lines do not have to end in newline characters. The following environment variables are automatically injected into the container: PACH_JOB_ID – the ID of the current job. PACH_OUTPUT_COMMIT_ID – the ID of the commit in the output repo for the current job. \u0026lt;input\u0026gt;_COMMIT - the ID of the input commit. For example, if your input is the images repo, this will be images_COMMIT. secrets reference Kubernetes secrets by name and specify a path to map the secrets or an environment variable (env_var) that the value should be bound to. 0 is always considered a successful exit code. tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write count against your container\u0026rsquo;s memory limit. This may be useful for workloads that are IO heavy or use memory caches. When to Use # You must always use the transform attribute when making a pipeline.\n",

If it is the last branch in the repo, the repo is also deleted. Unlike S3, you can delete non-empty branches.\nListObjects # Route: GET /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;/\nOnly S3\u0026rsquo;s list objects v1 is supported.\nPFS directories are represented via CommonPrefixes. This largely mirrors how S3 is used in practice, but leads to a couple of differences:\nIf you set the delimiter parameter, it must be /. Empty directories are included in listed results. With regard to listed results:\nDue to PFS peculiarities, the LastModified field references when the most recent commit to the branch happened, which may or may not have modified the specific object listed. The HTTP ETag field does not use MD5, but is a cryptographically secure hash of the file contents. The S3 StorageClass and Owner fields always have the same filler value. GetBucketLocation # Route: GET /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;/?location\nThis will always serve the same location for every bucket, but the endpoint is implemented to provide better compatibility with S3 clients.\nGetBucketVersioning # Route: GET /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;/?versioning\nThis will get whether versioning is enabled, which is always true.\nListMultipartUploads # Route: GET /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;/?uploads\nLists the in-progress multipart uploads in the given branch. The delimiter query parameter is not supported.\nCreateBucket # Route: PUT /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;/.\nIf the repo does not exist, it is created. If the branch does not exist, it is likewise created. As per S3\u0026rsquo;s behavior in some regions (but not all), trying to create the same bucket twice will return a BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou error.\nDeleteObjects # Route: POST /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;/?delete.\nDeletes multiple files specified in the request payload.\nDeleteObject # Route: DELETE /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;filepath\u0026gt;.\nDeletes the PFS file filepath in an atomic commit on the HEAD of branch.\nGetObject # Route: GET /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;filepath\u0026gt;.\nBy default, this request gets the HEAD version of the file. You can use s3\u0026rsquo;s versioning API to get the object at a non-HEAD commit by specifying either a specific commit ID, or by using the caret syntax \u0026ndash; for example, HEAD^.\nThere is support for range queries and conditional requests, however error response bodies for bad requests using these headers are not standard S3 XML.\nWith regard to HTTP response headers:\nDue to PFS peculiarities, the HTTP Last-Modified header references when the most recent commit to the branch happened, which may or may not have modified this specific object. The HTTP ETag does not use MD5, but is a cryptographically secure hash of the file contents. PutObject # Route: PUT /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;filepath\u0026gt;.\nWrites the PFS file at filepath in an atomic commit on the HEAD of branch.\nAny existing file content is overwritten. Unlike S3, there is no limit to upload size.\nUnlike s3, a 64mb max size is not enforced on this endpoint. Especially, as the file upload size gets larger, we recommend setting the Content-MD5 request header to ensure data integrity.\nAbortMultipartUpload # Route: DELETE /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;?uploadId=\u0026lt;uploadId\u0026gt;\nAborts an in-progress multipart upload.\nCompleteMultipartUpload # Route: POST /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;?uploadId=\u0026lt;uploadId\u0026gt;\nCompletes a multipart upload. If ETags are included in the request payload, they must be of the same format as returned by the S3 gateway when the multipart chunks are included. If they are md5 hashes or any other hash algorithm, they are ignored.\nCreateMultipartUpload # Route: POST /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;?uploads\nInitiates a multipart upload.\nListParts # Route: GET /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;?uploadId=\u0026lt;uploadId\u0026gt;\nLists the parts of an in-progress multipart upload.\nUploadPart # Route: PUT /\u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;?uploadId=\u0026lt;uploadId\u0026gt;\u0026amp;partNumber=\u0026lt;partNumber\u0026gt;\nUploads a chunk of a multipart upload.\n",

		"body": " ℹ️ For POCs and smaller organizations with one single Pachyderm cluster, the Enterprise Server services can be run embedded in pachd. A separate deployment is not necessary. An organization with a single Pachyderm cluster can run the Enterprise Server services embedded within pachd.\nThe setup of an Enterprise Server requires to:\nDeploy it. Activate your Enterprise Key and enable Auth. Register your newly created or existing Pachyderm clusters with your enterprise server. Optional: Enable Auth on each cluster. ⚠️ We are now shipping Pachyderm with an embedded proxy allowing your nterprise server to expose one single port externally. This deployment setup is optional.\nIf you choose to deploy your enterprise server with a Proxy, check out our new recommended architecture and deployment instructions as they alter the instructions below.\n1. Deploy An Enterprise Server # Deploying and configuring an enterprise server can be done in one of two flavors:\nProvide all licensing and authentication configurations as a part of the Helm deployment. Or, install a bare-bones version of Pachyderm with Helm, then use pachctl commands to set up licensing and authentication. As Part Of A Regular Pachyderm Helm Deployment # Update your values.yaml with your enterprise license key and auth configurations (for an example on localhost, see the example values.yaml here) or check our minimal example below to your values.yaml.\n⚠️ If a pachyderm cluster will also be installed in the same kubernetes cluster, they should be installed in different namespaces: kubectl create namespace enterprise helm install ... --set enterpriseServer.enabled=true --namespace enterprise This command deploys postgres, etcd and a deployment and service called pach-enterprise. pach-enterprise uses the same docker image and pachd binary, but it listens on a different set of ports (31650, 31657, 31658) to avoid conflicts with pachd.\nCheck the state of your deployment by running: kubectl get all --namespace enterprise System Response\nNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/etcd-5fd7c675b6-46kz7 1/1 Running 0 113m pod/pach-enterprise-6dc9cb8f66-rs44t 1/1 Running 0 105m pod/postgres-6bfd7bfc47-9mz28 1/1 Running 0 113m values.yaml for a stand-alone Enterprise Server as part of a multi-cluster deployment # Deploying a stand-alone enterprise server requires setting the helm parameter `enterpriseServer.enabled` to `true` and the `pachd.enabled` to `false`. enterpriseServer: enabled: true pachd: enabled: false enterpriseLicenseKey: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;ENTERPRISE-LICENSE-KEY\u0026gt;\u0026#34;

Retrieve Pachyderm external IP address if necessary. ISSUER, CLIENT-ID, CLIENT-SECRET: Refer to our Identity Provider Configuration page.\nCheck the list of all available helm values at your disposal in our reference documentation or on Github.\n⚠️ When enterprise is enabled through Helm, auth is automatically activated (i.e., you do not need to run pachctl auth activate) and a pachyderm-auth k8s secret is created containing a rootToken key. Use {{\u0026quot;kubectl get secret pachyderm-auth -o go-template='{{.data.rootToken | base64decode }}'\u0026quot;}} to retrieve it and save it where you see fit. However, this secret is only used when configuring through helm:\nIf you run pachctl auth activate, the secret is not updated. Instead, the rootToken is printed in your STDOUT for you to save.\nSame behavior if you activate enterprise manually (pachctl license activate) then activate authentication (pachctl auth activate). Set the helm value pachd.activateAuth to false to prevent the automatic bootstrap of auth on the cluster.\nOn An Existing Pachyderm Cluster # To enable the Enterprise Server on an existing cluster:\nactivate your enterprise key and authentication as described in the following chapter. then proceed to configuring IDP integrations. 2. Activate Enterprise Licensing And Enable Authentication # Use your enterprise key to activate your enterprise server: echo \u0026lt;your-activation-token\u0026gt; | pachctl license activate Then enable Authentication at the Enterprise Server level: pachctl auth activate --enterprise ⚠️ Enabling Auth will return a root token for the enterprise server. This is separate from the root tokens for each pachd (cluster). They should all be stored securely.\nOnce the enterprise server is deployed, deploy your cluster(s) helm install... and register it(them) with the enterprise server. Note that you have the option to register your clusters directly in your values.yaml when deploying or after its deployment, using pachctl.\nYou might want to expose your cluster(s) to the internet. Check the setup of a Load Balancer in our deployment section.\n3. Register Your Cluster With The Enterprise Server # Similarly to the enterprise server, we can configure our pachyderm clusters to leverage Helm for licensing and authentication in one of two flavors:\nProvide enterprise registration information as a part of the Helm deployment of a cluster. Register a cluster with the Enterprise Server using pachctl commands. Register Clusters With Helm # Add the enterprise server\u0026rsquo;s root token, and network addresses to the values.yaml of each cluster you plan to deploy and register, for the cluster and enterprise server to communicate (for an example on localhost, see the example values.yaml here), or insert our minimal example below to your values.yaml.\nvalues.yaml with activation of an enterprise license and authentication # pachd: activateEnterpriseMember: true enterpriseServerAddress: \u0026#34;grpc://\u0026lt;ENTERPRISE_SERVER_ADDRESS\u0026gt;\u0026#34; enterpriseCallbackAddress: \u0026#34;grpc://\u0026lt;PACHD_ADDRESS\u0026gt;\u0026#34; enterpriseServerToken: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;ENTERPRISE-SERVER-TOKEN\u0026gt;\u0026#34; # the same root token of the enterprise cluster # Alternatively, use a secret enterpriseServerTokenSecretName: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Name of you secret containing enterpriseServerToken\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ⚠️ When setting your enterprise server info as part of the Helm deployment of a cluster, auth is automatically activated unless the helm value pachd.activateAuth was intentionally set to false. (i.e., you can skip step 4).\nIn this case, a pachyderm-auth k8s secret is automatically created containing an entry for your rootToken in the key rootToken. Use the following to retrieve it and save it where you see fit:\n{{\u0026#34;kubectl get secret pachyderm-auth -o go-template=\u0026#39;{{.data.rootToken | base64decode }}\u0026#39;\u0026#34;}} Register Clusters With pachctl # Run this command for each of the clusters you wish to register using pachctl:\npachctl enterprise register --id \u0026lt;my-pachd-config-name\u0026gt; --enterprise-server-address \u0026lt;pach-enterprise-IP\u0026gt;:650 --pachd-address \u0026lt;pachd-IP\u0026gt;:650 --id is the name of the context pointing to your cluster in ~/.pachyderm/config.json.\n--enterprise-server-address is the host and port where pachd can reach the enterprise server. In production, the enterprise server may be exposed on the internet.\n--pachd-address is the host and port where the enterprise server can reach pachd. This may be internal to the kubernetes cluster, or over the internet.\nDisplay the list of all registered clusters with your enterprise server:\npachctl license list-clusters Using enterprise context: my-enterprise-context-name id: john address: ae1ba915f8b5b477c98cd26c67d7563b-66539067.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:650 version: 2.0.0 auth_enabled: true last_heartbeat: 2021-05-21 18:37:36.072156 +0000 UTC --- id: doe address: 34.71.247.191:650 version: 2.0.0 auth_enabled: true last_heartbeat: 2021-05-21 18:43:42.157027 +0000 UTC --- 4. Enable Auth On Each Cluster # Finally, if your clusters were registered with the Enterprise Server using pachctl, you might choose to activate auth on each (or some) of them. This is an optional step. Clusters can be registered with the enterprise server without authentication being enabled.\nBefore enabling authentication, set up the issuer in the idp config between the enterprise server and your cluster:\necho \u0026#34;issuer: http://\u0026lt;enterprise-server-IP\u0026gt;:658\u0026#34; | pachctl idp set-config --config - Check that your config has been updated properly: pachctl idp get-config\nFor each registered cluster you want to enable auth on:\npachctl auth activate --client-id \u0026lt;my-pachd-config-name\u0026gt; --redirect http://\u0026lt;pachd-IP\u0026gt;:657/authorization-code/callback ℹ️ Note the /authorization-code/callback appended after \u0026lt;pachd-IP\u0026gt;:657 in --redirect. --client-id is to pachctl auth activate what --id is to pachctl enterprise register: In both cases, enter \u0026lt;my-pachd-config-name\u0026gt;. Make sure than your enterprise context is set up properly: pachctl config get active-enterprise-context If not:\npachctl config set active-enterprise-context \u0026lt;my-enterprise-context-name\u0026gt; To manage you server, its context, or connect your IdP, visit the Manage your Enterprise Server page.\n",

Usually to do that you adjust a security rule (in AWS parlance a security group). For example, on AWS, if you find your node in the web console and click on it, you should see a link to the associated security group. Inspect that group.

Default is 100. STORAGE_PUT_FILE_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT limits the number of parallel downloads pachd will initiate. Default is also 100. You may use a binary search technique to hone in on a value appropriate for a production pipeline:\nfor cache_size, max it out. If it works, halve it. If its OOM killed, increase the value by 50%. and so on for the CONCURRENCY_LIMITS, halve and increase by 50% until you get a value that works.\n",

		"body": " Introduction # Job failures can occur for a variety of reasons, but they generally categorize into 4 failure types:\nYou hit one of the Pachyderm Community Edition Scaling Limits. User-code-related: An error in the user code running inside the container or the json pipeline config. Data-related: A problem with the input data such as incorrect file type or file name. System- or infrastructure-related: An error in Pachyderm or Kubernetes such as missing credentials, transient network errors, or resource constraints (for example, out-of-memory\u0026ndash;OOM\u0026ndash;killed). In this document, we\u0026rsquo;ll show you the tools for determining what kind of failure it is. For each of the failure modes, we’ll describe Pachyderm’s and Kubernetes’s specific retry and error-reporting behaviors as well as typical user triaging methodologies.\nFailed jobs in a pipeline will propagate information to downstream pipelines with empty commits to preserve provenance and make tracing the failed job easier. A failed job is no longer running.\nIn this document, we\u0026rsquo;ll describe what you\u0026rsquo;ll see, how Pachyderm will respond, and techniques for triaging each of those three categories of failure.\nAt the bottom of the document, we\u0026rsquo;ll provide specific troubleshooting steps for specific scenarios.\nPipeline exists but never runs All your pods or jobs get evicted Determining the kind of failure # First off, you can see the status of Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s jobs with pachctl list job --expand, which will show you the status of all jobs. For a failed job, use pachctl inspect job \u0026lt;job-id\u0026gt; to find out more about the failure. The different categories of failures are addressed below.\nCommunity Edition Scaling Limits # If you are running on the Community Edition, you might have hit the limit set on the number of pipelines and/or parallel workers.\nThat scenario is quite easy to troubleshoot:\nCheck your number of pipelines and parallelism settings (\u0026quot;parallelism_spec\u0026quot; attribute in your pipeline specification files) against our limits.\nAdditionally, your stderr and pipeline logs (pachctl log -p \u0026lt;pipeline name\u0026gt; --master or pachctl log -p \u0026lt;pipeline name\u0026gt; --worker) should contain one or both of those messages:\nnumber of pipelines limit exceeded: Pachyderm Community Edition requires an activation key to create more than 16 total pipelines (you have X). Use the command pachctl license activate to enter your key.\nPachyderm offers readily available activation keys for proofs-of-concept, startups, academic, nonprofit, or open-source projects. Tell us about your project to get one.\nmax number of workers exceeded: This pipeline will only create a total of 8 workers (you specified X). Pachyderm Community Edition requires an activation key to create pipelines with constant parallelism greater than 8. Use the command pachctl license activate to enter your key.\nPachyderm offers readily available activation keys for proofs-of-concept, startups, academic, nonprofit, or open-source projects. Tell us about your project to get one.\nTo lift those limitations, Request an Enterprise Edition trial token. Check out our Enterprise features for more details on our Enterprise Offer.\nUser Code Failures # When there’s an error in user code, the typical error message you’ll see is\nfailed to process datum \u0026lt;UUID\u0026gt; with error: \u0026lt;user code error\u0026gt; This means pachyderm successfully got to the point where it was running user code, but that code exited with a non-zero error code. If any datum in a pipeline fails, the entire job will be marked as failed, but datums that did not fail will not need to be reprocessed on future jobs. You can use pachctl inspect datum \u0026lt;job-id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;datum-id\u0026gt; or pachctl logs with the --pipeline, --job or --datum flags to get more details.\nThere are some cases where users may want mark a datum as successful even for a non-zero error code by setting the transform.accept_return_code field in the pipeline config .\nRetries # Pachyderm will automatically retry user code three (3) times before marking the datum as failed. This mitigates datums failing for transient connection reasons.\nTriage # pachctl logs --job=\u0026lt;job_ID\u0026gt; or pachctl logs --pipeline=\u0026lt;pipeline_name\u0026gt; will print out any logs from your user code to help you triage the issue. Kubernetes will rotate logs occasionally so if nothing is being returned, you’ll need to make sure that you have a persistent log collection tool running in your cluster.\nIn cases where user code is failing, changes first need to be made to the code and followed by updating the pachyderm pipeline. This involves building a new docker container with the corrected code, modifying the pachyderm pipeline config to use the new image, and then calling pachctl update pipeline -f updated_pipeline_config.json. Depending on the issue/error, user may or may not want to also include the --reprocess flag with update pipeline.\nData Failures # When there’s an error in the data, this will typically manifest in a user code error such as\nfailed to process datum \u0026lt;UUID\u0026gt; with error: \u0026lt;user code error\u0026gt; This means pachyderm successfully got to the point where it was running user code, but that code exited with a non-zero error code, usually due to being unable to find a file or a path, a misformatted file, or incorrect fields/data within a file. If any datum in a pipeline fails, the entire job will be marked as failed. Datums that did not fail will not need to be reprocessed on future jobs.\nRetries # Just like with user code failures, Pachyderm will automatically retry running a datum 3 times before marking the datum as failed. This mitigates datums failing for transient connection reasons.\nTriage # Data failures can be triaged in a few different way depending on the nature of the failure and design of the pipeline.\nIn some cases, where malformed datums are expected to happen occasionally, they can be “swallowed” (e.g. marked as successful using transform.accept_return_codes or written out to a “failed_datums” directory and handled within user code). This would simply require the necessary updates to the user code and pipeline config as described above. For cases where your code detects bad input data, a \u0026ldquo;dead letter queue\u0026rdquo; design pattern may be needed. Many pachyderm developers use a special directory in each output repo for \u0026ldquo;bad data\u0026rdquo; and pipelines with globs for detecting bad data direct that data for automated and manual intervention.\nIf a few files as part of the input commit are causing the failure, they can simply be removed from the HEAD commit with start commit, delete file, finish commit. The files can also be corrected in this manner as well. This method is similar to a revert in Git \u0026ndash; the “bad” data will still live in the older commits in Pachyderm, but will not be part of the HEAD commit and therefore not processed by the pipeline.\nSystem-level Failures # System-level failures are the most varied and often hardest to debug. We’ll outline a few common patterns and triage steps. Generally, you’ll need to look at deeper logs to find these errors using pachctl logs --pipeline=\u0026lt;pipeline_name\u0026gt; --raw and/or --master and kubectl logs pod \u0026lt;pod_name\u0026gt;.\nHere are some of the most common system-level failures:\nMalformed or missing credentials such that a pipeline cannot connect to object storage, registry, or other external service. In the best case, you’ll see permission denied errors, but in some cases you’ll only see “does not exist” errors (this is common reading from object stores) Out-of-memory (OOM) killed or other resource constraint issues such as not being able to schedule pods on available cluster resources. Network issues trying to connect Pachd, etcd, or other internal or external resources Failure to find or pull a docker image from the registry Retries # For system-level failures, Pachyderm or Kubernetes will generally continually retry the operation with exponential backoff. If a job is stuck in a given state (e.g. starting, merging) or a pod is in CrashLoopBackoff, those are common signs of a system-level failure mode.\nTriage # Triaging system failures varies as widely as the issues do themselves. Here are options for the common issues mentioned previously.\nCredentials: check your secrets in k8s, make sure they’re added correctly to the pipeline config, and double check your roles/perms within the cluster OOM: Increase the memory limit/request or node size for your pipeline. If you are very resource constrained, making your datums smaller to require less resources may be necessary. Network: Check to make sure etcd and pachd are up and running, that k8s DNS is correctly configured for pods to resolve each other and outside resources, firewalls and other networking configurations allow k8s components to reach each other, and ingress controllers are configured correctly Check your container image name in the pipeline config and image_pull_secret. Specific scenarios # All pods or jobs get evicted # Symptom # After creating a pipeline, a job starts but never progresses through any datums.\nRecourse # Run kubectl get pods and see if the command returns pods that are marked Evicted. If you run kubectl describe \u0026lt;pod-name\u0026gt; with one of those evicted pods, you might get an error saying that it was evicted due to disk pressure. This means that your nodes are not configured with a big enough root volume size. You need to make sure that each node\u0026rsquo;s root volume is big enough to store the biggest datum you expect to process anywhere on your DAG plus the size of the output files that will be written for that datum.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you have a repo with 100 folders. You have a single pipeline with this repo as an input, and the glob pattern is /*. That means each folder will be processed as a single datum. If the biggest folder is 50GB and your pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output is about three times as big, then your root volume size needs to be bigger than:\n50 GB (to accommodate the input) + 50 GB x 3 (to accommodate the output) = 200GB In this case we would recommend 250GB to be safe. If your root volume size is less than 50GB (many defaults are 20GB), this pipeline will fail when downloading the input. The pod may get evicted and rescheduled to a different node, where the same thing will happen.\nPipeline exists but never runs # Symptom # You can see the pipeline via pachctl list pipeline, but if you look at the job via pachctl list job --expand, it\u0026rsquo;s marked as running with 0/0 datums having been processed.\nIf you inspect the job via pachctl inspect job \u0026lt;pipeline_name\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;jobID\u0026gt;, you don\u0026rsquo;t see any worker set.\nE.g:\nWorker Status: WORKER JOB DATUM STARTED ... If you do kubectl get pod you see the worker pod for your pipeline, e.g:\npo/pipeline-foo-5-v1-273zc But it\u0026rsquo;s state is Pending or CrashLoopBackoff.\nRecourse # First make sure that there is no parent job still running. Do pachctl list job --expand| grep yourPipelineName to see if there are pending jobs on this pipeline that were kicked off prior to your job. A parent job is the job that corresponds to the parent output commit of this pipeline. A job will block until all parent jobs complete.\nIf there are no parent jobs that are still running, then continue debugging:\nDescribe the pod via:\nkubectl describe po/pipeline-foo-5-v1-273zc If the state is CrashLoopBackoff, you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a descriptive error message. One such cause for this behavior might be if you specified an image for your pipeline that does not exist.\nIf the state is Pending it\u0026rsquo;s likely the cluster doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough resources. In this case, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a could not schedule type of error message which should describe which resource you\u0026rsquo;re low on. This is more likely to happen if you\u0026rsquo;ve set resource requests (cpu/mem/gpu) for your pipelines. In this case, you\u0026rsquo;ll just need to scale up your resources. You can use your cloud provider\u0026rsquo;s auto scaling groups to increase the size of your instance group. It can take up to 10 minutes for the changes to go into effect.\nCannot Delete Pipelines with an etcd Error # Failed to delete a pipeline with an etcdserver error.\nSymptom # Deleting pipelines fails with the following error:\npachctl delete pipeline pipeline-name etcdserver: too many operations in txn request (XXXXXX comparisons, YYYYYYY writes: hint: set --max-txn-ops on the ETCD cluster to at least the largest of those values) Recourse # When a Pachyderm cluster reaches a certain scale, you need to adjust the default parameters provided for certain etcd flags. Depending on how you deployed Pachyderm, you need to either edit the etcd Deployment or StatefulSet.\nkubectl edit deploy etcd or\nkubectl edit statefulset etcd In the spec/template/containers/command path, set the value for max-txn-ops to a value appropriate for your cluster, in line with the advice in the error above: larger than the greater of XXXXXX or YYYYYYY.\nPipeline is stuck in starting # Symptom # After starting a pipeline, running the pachctl list pipeline command returns the starting status for a very long time. The kubectl get pods command returns the pipeline pods in a pending state indefinitely.\nRecourse # Run the kubectl describe pod \u0026lt;pipeline-pod\u0026gt; and analyze the information in the output of that command. Often, this type of error is associated with insufficient amount of CPU, memory, and GPU resources in your cluster.\n",

Shell # See the Shell Style Guide for standard conventions. Add set -eou pipefail to your scripts. Go # See the Effective Go Style Guide for standard conventions.\nNaming # Consider the package name when naming an interface to avoid redundancy. For example, storage.Interface is better than storage.StorageInterface. Do not use uppercase characters, underscores, or dashes in package names. The package foo line should match the name of the directory in which the .go file exists. Importers can use a different name if they need to disambiguate. When multiple locks are present, give each lock a distinct name following Go conventions (e.g., stateLock, mapLock). Go Modules/Third-Party Code # See the Go Modules Usage and Troubleshooting Guide for managing Go modules. Go dependencies are managed with go modules. Use go get foo to add or update a package; for more specific versions, use go get foo@v1.2.3, go get foo@master, or go get foo@e3702bed2. YAML # See the Helm Best Practices guide series. Review # See the Go Code Review Comments guide for a list of common comments. See the Go Test Comments guide for a list of common test code comments. Make sure CI is passing for your branch. Checks # Run checks using make lint. Testing # All packages and significant functionality must come with test coverage. Local unit tests should pass before pushing to GitHub (make localtest or make integration-tests for integrations). Use short flag for local tests only. Avoid waiting for asynchronous things to happen; If possible, use a method of waiting directly (e.g. \u0026lsquo;flush commit\u0026rsquo; is much better than repeatedly trying to read from a commit). Run single tests or tests from a single package; the Go tool only supports tests that match a regular expression (for example, go test -v ./src/path/to/package -run ^TestMyTest).

Use CI for that.\nFully resetting # Instead of running the makefile targets to re-compile pachctl and redeploy a dev cluster, we have a script that you can use to fully reset your pachyderm environment:\nAll existing cluster data is deleted If possible, the virtual machine that the cluster is running on is wiped out pachctl is recompiled The dev cluster is re-deployed This reset is a bit more time consuming than running one-off Makefile targets, but comprehensively ensures that the cluster is in its expected state, and is especially helpful when you\u0026rsquo;re first getting started with contributions and don\u0026rsquo;t yet have a complete intuition on the various ways a cluster may get in an unexpected state. It\u0026rsquo;s been tested on docker for mac and minikube, but likely works in other kubernetes environments as well.\nTo run it, simply call ./etc/reset.py from the pachyderm repo root.\n",

Open your terminal (ctrl+`). Add the following to your settings.json: \u0026#34;terminal.integrated.shell.windows\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Git\\\\bin\\\\bash.exe\u0026#34;, This path may vary depending on where your git bash actually exists.\nGetting started # Open a terminal and navigate to a directory you\u0026rsquo;d like to store Pachyderm. Clone the pachyderm repo using git clone https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm. Launch Docker Desktop (with Kubernetes enabled) or start minikube. Provision ~10 GB of memory and ~4CPUs. Via minikube: minikube start --memory=10000mb --cpus=4 --disk-size=40000mb --driver=hyperv Via Docker Desktop: Open Docker Desktop and navigate to Preferences \u0026gt; Resources \u0026gt; Advanced. Build your pachyderm pachd and worker images via the task docker-build. Option 1: Navigate to Terminal \u0026gt; Run Task\u0026hellip; Option 2: Press ctrl+p and input task docker-build Build and install pachctl. Launch a Pachyderm cluster by running the task launch-dev. If the service does not come up promptly (the script never says all the pods are ready), see the Debugging section.\nDebugging # Common Commands # The following commands are used frequently when working with Pachyderm:\nkubectl get all: lists resources in the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; namespace, where we deploy locally. kubectl logs -p \u0026lt;pod\u0026gt;: gets the logs from the previous attempt at running a pod; a good place to find errors. minikube logs: gets the logs from minikube itself, useful when a pod runs into a CreateContainerError. docker container ls: lists recently used or in-use docker containers; used to get logs more directly. docker logs \u0026lt;container\u0026gt;: gets the logs from a specific docker container. Gotchas # Docker can get confused by command-line windows-style paths; it reads : as a mode and fails to parse. You may want to export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 to prevent the automated conversion of unix-to-windows paths. Kubernetes resource specs (specifically hostPath) do not work if you use a windows-style path. Instead, you must use a unix-style path where the drive letter is the first directory, e.g. /C/path/to/file. Etcd may fail to mmap files when in a directory shared with the host system. Full Restart # Minikube # If you\u0026rsquo;d like to completely restart, use the following terminal commands:\nminikube delete kubectl delete pvc -l suite=pachyderm minikube start --memory=10000mb --cpus=4 --disk-size=40000mb ",

		"body": "Thank you for taking an interest in contributing to Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s docs! 🐘 📖\nThis style guide provides editorial guidelines for writing clear and consistent Pachyderm product documentation. See our contribution guide for instructions on how to draft and submit changes.\nAudience # Pachyderm has two main audiences:\nMLOPs Engineers: They install and configure Pachyderm to transform data using pipelines. Data Scientists \u0026amp; Data/ML Engineers: They plan the development of pipelines and consume the outputs of Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s data processing to feed AI/ML models. Be sure to provide links to pre-requisite or contextual materials whenever possible, as everyone\u0026rsquo;s experience level and career journey is different.\nVoice \u0026amp; Tone # Pachyderm\u0026rsquo;s voice in documentation should consistently convey a personality that is friendly, knowledgeable, and empathetic.\nThe tone of voice may vary depending on the type of content being written. For example, a danger notice may use an urgent and serious tone while a tutorial may use an energetic and instructive tone. Make sure the tone of your documentation aligns with the content. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure what tone to convey, ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;What is the reader likely feeling when presented this content? Why are they here?\u0026rdquo; and adjust your language to the most appropriate tone.\nLanguage \u0026amp; Grammar # The following guidelines are to be followed loosely; use your best judgment when approaching content \u0026ndash; there are always exceptions.\nUse Active Voice # Write in active voice to enforce clarity and simplicity.\n👎🚫 Don\u0026rsquo;t 👍✅ Do The update was failing due to a configuration issue. The update failed due to a configuration issue. A POST request is sent and a response is returned. Send a POST request; the endpoint sends a response. You can break this rule to emphasize an object (the image is installed) or de-emphasize a subject (5 errors were found in this article).\nUse Global English # Write documentation using Global English. Global English makes comprehension easier for all audiences by avoiding regional idioms/expressions and standardizing spelling words using the US English variant.\nPut Conditional Clauses First # Order conditional clauses first when drafting sentences; this empowers the reader to skip to the next step when the condition does not apply.\n👎🚫 Don\u0026rsquo;t 👍✅ Do See this page for more information on how to use this feature. For more information, see How to Use Console. Enable the CustomField setting if you want to map custom fields. To map custom fields, enable the CustomField setting. Write Accessibly # Be mindful of how you describe software behavior and users; in particular, avoid ableist language. Use generic \u0026ldquo;they/them\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo; when describing users or actors; avoid the use of \u0026ldquo;obviously\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;simply\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;easily\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; every reader has a different level of expertise and familiarity with key concepts/tools.\n👎🚫 Don\u0026rsquo;t 👍✅ Do To start, simply enter the following command: To start, enter the following command: Configuring this setting just requires a simple API call. Make an API call to configure this setting. The results, without this setting enabled, might look crazy. Your results may be inconsistent or unreliable without this setting enabled. Formatting \u0026amp; Punctuation # Markdown # All documentation is written using Markdown syntax in .md files. See this official Markdown Cheat Sheet for a quick introduction to the syntax.\nCode Blocks # Use ``` to wrap long code samples into a code block.\nThis is a code block. Headers # Use title casing for all header titles.\nCapitalize the first and last word. Capitalize adjectives, adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and subordinate conjuctions. Lowercase articles (a, an, the) and coordinating conjunctions (and, but,for, nor, or, so, yet). 👎🚫 Don\u0026rsquo;t 👍✅ Do How to develop sentient ai How to Develop Sentient AI How to use the pachctl cli How to Use the Pachctl CLI Links # Use meaningful link descriptions, such as the original article\u0026rsquo;s title or a one-line summarization of its contents.\nExamples:\n- See the [Pachyderm Technical Documentation Style Guide](../docs-style-guide) - Use the [official Pachyderm style guide](../docs-style-guide). Lists # Use numbered lists for sequential items, such as instructions. Use unbulleted lists for all other list types (like this list). Commas # Use the serial or Oxford comma in a list of three or more items to minimize any chance of confusion.\n👎🚫 Don\u0026rsquo;t 👍✅ Do I like swimming, biking and singing. I like swimming, biking, and singing. I only trust my parents, Madonna and Shakira. I only trust my parents, Madonna, and Shakira. UI Elements # Bold UI elements when mentioned in a set of instructions (a numbered list).\nNavigate to Settings \u0026gt; Desktop. Scroll to Push Notifications. Organization # Use Nested Headers # Remember to use all header sizes (h1-h6) to organize information. Each header should be a subset of topics or examples more narrow in scope than its parents. This enables readers to both gain more context and mentally parse the information at a glance.\nPublish Modular Topics # Avoid mixing objectives or use cases in one article; instead, organize and separate your content so that it is task-based. If there are many substasks (such as in a long-form tutorial), organize your content so that each major step is itself an article.\nExamples:\nThe below outlines are 4 articles, with the parent article linking to each modular sub-topic.\nHow to Locally Deploy Pachyderm MacOS Local Deployment Guide Linux Local Deployment Guide Windows Local Deployment Guide Images \u0026amp; Diagrams # Visualizations are helpful in learning complex workflows and UIs; however, they can expire quickly and take a lot of effort to maintain. Ask yourself the following questions when deciding whether or not to add visualizations:\nIs the user interface complex enough to warrant a screenshot? Can a diagram convey this concept more efficiently than words? How frequently does this visual need to be updated? Also, remember to add alt-text to your visualizations for screen readers.\nMermaid # You can build diagrams using mermaid.js in our documentation by:\nAdding mermaid: true to the frontmatter of an article. Drafting a diagram, like so: ```mermaid graph TD; A--\u0026gt;B; A--\u0026gt;C; B--\u0026gt;D; C--\u0026gt;D; ``` graph TD; A--\u0026gt;B; A--\u0026gt;C; B--\u0026gt;D; C--\u0026gt;D; Want to make an update to this style guide?
