As new versions of Pachyderm are released, you might need to update
your cluster to get access to bug fixes and new features.
These updates fall into the following categories:

* An [**upgrade**](../upgrades/) moves between **minor or patch releases**.
For example, between version 2.1.2 and 2.2.0. 
Upgrades are typically a simple process should require little to no downtime.

* Migrations â€” A **migration** must be performed when you are **moving between major releases**,
For questions on how to migrate, please contact your technical account manager or email support@pachyderm.com.

{{% notice danger %}}
Performing an *upgrade* between *major releases* might lead to corrupted data. You must perform a migration when going between major versions.

Whether you upgrade or migrate your cluster, Pachyderm recommends that you
[perform a back up](../backup-restore/). A backup guarantees that you can restore
your cluster to its previous, stable state.
